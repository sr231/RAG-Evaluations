"What specific measures did the American Rescue Plan implement to address the economic and social impacts of the pandemic? 
","['THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you. Good to be back. And Mitch and Chuck will understand it’s good to be almost home, down the hall. Anyway, thank you all.\n\nMadam Speaker, Madam Vice President — (applause) — no President has ever said those words from this podium. No President has ever said those words, and it’s about time. (Applause.)\n\nFirst Lady — (applause) — I’m her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different — a reminder of the extraordinary times we’re in.\n\nThroughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to Congress, to the nation, and to the world to declare war, to celebrate peace, to announce new plans and possibilities.\n\nTonight, I come to talk about crisis and opportunity, about rebuilding the nation, revitalizing our democracy, and winning the future for America.\n\nI stand here tonight, one day shy of the 100th day of my administration — 100 days since I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a nation — we all did — that was in crisis.\n\nThe worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\n\nNow, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again — (applause) — turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength.\n\nWe all know life can knock us down. But in America, we never, ever, ever stay down. Americans always get up. Today, that’s what we’re doing: America is rising anew, choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, and light over darkness.\n\nAfter 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff, in my view. We’re working again, dreaming again, discovering again, and leading the world again.\n\nWe have shown each other and the world that there’s no quit in America — none.\n\nOne hundred days ago, America’s house was on fire. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi; Malor- — Majority Leader Schumer; and the overwhelming support of the American people — Democrats, independents, and Republicans — we did act.\n\nTogether we passed the American Rescue Plan — one of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We’re already seeing the results. (Applause.) We’re already seeing the results.\n\nAfter I promised we’d get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into people’s arms in 100 days, we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days. (Applause.)\n\nThanks to all the help of all of you, we’re marshalling — with your help, everyone’s help — we’re marshalling every federal resource. We’ve gotten vaccines to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 Community Health Centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached. We’re setting up community vaccination sites, developing mobile units to get to hard-to-reach communities.\n\nToday, 90 percent of Americans now live within five miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16 — everyone is now eligible to get vaccinated right now, right away. (Applause.) Go get vaccinated, America. Go and get the vaccination. They’re available. You’re eligible now.\n\nWhen I was sworn in on January 20th, less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. One hundred days later, 70 percent of seniors in America over 65 are protected — fully protected.\n\nSenior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80 percent since January — down 80 percent because of all of you. And more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shot.\n\nAt a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse — I said, “What’s it like?”  She looked at me and she said, “It’s like every shot is giving a dose of hope” — was the phrase. “A dose of hope.”\n\nA dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune disease — wrote to me, said she’s worried — that she was worrying about bringing the virus home. She said she then got vaccinated at a — at a large site, in her car.

"The speaker proposes a Jobs and Family Plan that aims to invest in education, childcare, paid leave, and tax credits for families. To fund this plan, the speaker suggests raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest 1% of Americans. How does the speaker propose to reform corporate taxes to pay for the Jobs and Family Plan?","[' put forward their own proposal.\n\nSo, let’s get to work. I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the deep discussions. I’d like to meet with those who have ideas that are different — they think are better. I welcome those ideas.\n\nBut the rest of the world is not waiting for us. I just want to be clear: From my perspective, doing nothing is not an option. (Applause.)\n\nLook, we can’t be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.\n\nSecretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi — traveled over 17,000 miles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him. When he called to congratulate me, we had a two-hour discussion. He’s deadly earnest about becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world. He and others — autocrats — think that democracy can’t compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus.\n\nTo win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children. That’s why I’ve introduced the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.\n\nFirst is access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world. It’s, I believe, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st — in the 20th century.\n\nBut the world has caught up, or catching up. They are not waiting. I would say, parenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, “Okay, we’re going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education,” I wonder whether we’d think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century. I doubt it. Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st Century.\n\nThat’s why my American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.\n\nThe great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years. It shows that adding two years of universal high-quality preschool for every three-year-old and four-year-old, no matter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years. It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduation.\n\nThe research shows when a young child goes to school — not daycare — they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.\n\nWhen you add two years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the dynamic. (Applause.) We can do that. (Applause.)\n\nAnd we’ll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions. The reason is: They don’t have the endowments, but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy — all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.\n\nJill was  a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said — (applause). She has long — (applause). If I’ve heard it once, I’ve heard it a thousand times: “Joe, any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us.”  She’ll be deeply involved in leading this effort. Thank you, Jill.\n\nSecond thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare. We guarantee — (applause). And I’m proposing a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime.\n\nThird, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave  and medical leave — family and medical leave. We’re one of the few industrial countries in the world — (applause).\n\nNo one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones –']",The answer to the given question is not present in the context.,simple,"[{'source': 'Speeches/state_of_the_union_042921.txt', 'filename': 'Speeches/state_of_the_union_042921.txt'}]",True
"How does the American Jobs Plan address climate change and create jobs in the process?

And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water — a clear and present danger to our children’s health.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water. (Applause.)\n\nAnd in the process, it will create thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed Internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn’t have it.\n\nThis is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st-century economy.\n\nAnd I am asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Of course.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — because I know it will get done. (Applause.)\n\nIt creates jobs, building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, catastrophic failures — with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. We can do that. (Applause.)\n\nLook, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers.\n\nTwo million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic — two million.

Jobs.

We have this capacity. (Applause.) We have the brightest, best-trained people in the world.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of good-paying jobs — jobs Americans can raise a family on — as my dad would then say, “with a little breathing room.”\n\nAnd all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: Buy American. (Applause.) Buy American.\n\nAnd I might note, parenthetically — (applause) — that does not — that does not violate any trade agreement. It’s been the law since the ’30s: Buy American.\n\nAmerican tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs. That’s the way it’s supposed to be and it will be in this administration. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I made it clear to all my Cabinet people.

"Can boosting US car & semiconductor production curb inflation, given current manufacturing conditions and policies?","[' that comes from stamping products “Made In America.” The revitalization of American manufacturing.\n\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas.\n\nThat’s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country.\n\nGM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.\n\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year.\n\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight.\n\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.”\n\nIt’s time.\n\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.\n\nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel.\n\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control.\n\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories.\n\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains.\n\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up.\n\nLook at cars.\n\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy.\n\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up.\n\nSo—we have a choice.\n\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.\n\nI have a better plan to fight inflation.\n\nLower your costs, not your wages.\n\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America.\n\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America.\n\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America.\n\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America.\n\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.\n\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.”\n\nI call it building a better America.\n\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit.\n\n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan:\n\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.\n\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.\n\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom.\n\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.\n\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be.\n\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.\n\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.\n\nDrug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does.\n\nLook, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent.\n\nSecond – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.\n\nLet’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again.\n\nThird – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.\n\nMiddle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.\n\nMy plan will']","The text discusses the revitalization of American manufacturing, specifically mentioning Ford and GM investing in electric vehicle production, creating jobs, and increasing manufacturing output. The text also points out the shortage of semiconductors as a factor in rising car prices.

Who does the American Jobs Plan aim to connect to high-speed internet?,"['. This is the largest jobs plan since World War Two.\n\nIt creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors, transit lines.\n\nIt’s clean water. And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water — a clear and present danger to our children’s health.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water. (Applause.)\n\nAnd in the process, it will create thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed Internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn’t have it.\n\nThis is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st-century economy.\n\nAnd I am asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would —\n\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Of course.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT:  — because I know it will get done. (Applause.)\n\nIt creates jobs, building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, catastrophic failures — with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. We can do that. (Applause.)\n\nLook, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers.\n\nTwo million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic — two million. And too often because they couldn’t get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs help.\n\nEight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. If you think it’s not important, check out in your own district.\n\nDemocrat or Republican — Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern — almost as much as their children — is taking care of an elderly loved one who can’t be left alone. Medicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth.\n\nFor too long, we’ve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis: “jobs.”  Jobs. Jobs. (Applause.)\n\nFor me, when I think “climate change,” I think “jobs.”\n\nThe American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy-efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers — IBEW members — installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways so we can own — (applause) — so we can own the electric car market. (Applause.)\n\nFarmers — farmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. (Applause.)\n\nLook, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason. None. No reason. (Applause.)\n\nSo, folks, there’s no reason why American — American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. I mean, there is no reason. We have this capacity. (Applause.) We have the brightest, best-trained people in the world.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of good-paying jobs — jobs Americans can raise a family on — as my dad would then say, “with a little breathing room.”\n\nAnd all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: Buy American. (Applause.) Buy American.\n\nAnd I might note, parenthetically — (applause) — that does not — that does not violate any trade agreement. It’s been the law since the ’30s: Buy American.\n\nAmerican tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs. That’s the way it’s supposed to be and it will be in this administration. (Applause.)\n\nAnd I made it clear to all my Cabinet people. Their ability to give exemptions has been exstrenuously [sic] limited. It will be American products.\n\nNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you.

How do the speaker's historical examples of infrastructure investment support their argument?,"[' vaccinated, and just cried — cried out of joy and cried out of relief.\n\nParents see the smiles on their kids’ faces, for those who are able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.\n\nGrandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a window to say goodbye.\n\nIt means everything. Those things mean everything.\n\nYou know, there’s still — you all know it; you know it better than any group of Americans — there’s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can’t let our guard down.\n\nBut tonight I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievements — logistical achievements this country has ever seen.\n\nWhat else have we done in those first 100 days?\n\nWe kept our commitment — Democrats and Republicans — of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households. We’ve already sent more than one — 160 million checks out the door. It’s making the difference. You all know it when you go home. For many people, it’s making all the difference in the world.\n\nA single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said she couldn’t work, but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment.\n\nA grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor — something she said she put off for months because she didn’t have the money.\n\nOne of the defining images, at least from my perspective, of this crisis has been cars lined up — cars lined up for miles. And not — not people who just barely ever start those cars — nice cars lined up for miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.\n\nI don’t know about you, but I didn’t ever think I’d see that in America. And all of this is through no fault of their own. No fault of their own these people are in this position.\n\nThat’s why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already.\n\nWe’re also providing rental assistance — you all know this, but the American people, I want to make sure they understand — keeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job.\n\nDuring these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established the special sign-up period to do that — 800,000 in that period.\n\nWe’re making one of the largest one-time ever investments — ever — in improving healthcare for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we’re on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. (Applause.)\n\nAnd in the process, while this was all going on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 new jobs in 100 days — more jobs in the first — (applause) — more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund — (applause) — the International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades.\n\nAmerica is moving — moving forward — but we can’t stop now. We’re in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century. We’re at a great inflection point in history.\n\nWe have to do more than just build back better — I mean “build back.”  We have to build back better. We have to compete more strenuously than we have.\n\nThroughout our history, if you think about it, public investment and infrastructure has literally transformed America — our attitudes, as well as our opportunities.\n\nThe transcontinental railroad, the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of America.\n\nUniversal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity.\n\nScientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon — now we’re on Mars; discovering vaccines; gave us the Internet and so much more.\n\nThese are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the government was in a position to make. Time and again, they propel us into the future.\n\nThat’s why I proposed the American Jobs Plan — a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself']","The speaker argues that public investment in infrastructure has historically transformed America, leading to progress and opportunity.

How are veterans being supported with housing & mental health?,"[' I never believed it.\n\nThat’s why a year ago, I offered a Unity Agenda for the nation.\n\nWe’ve made real progress.\n\nTogether, we passed a law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction.\n\nPassed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental health.\n\nLaunched ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and so much more.\n\nWe passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named for the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year.\n\nBut there is so much more to do. And we can do it together.\n\nJoining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire.\n\nHe wrote Jill and me a letter about his daughter Courtney. Contagious laugh. Her sister’s best friend.\n\nHe shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans.\n\nCourtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually her death from a fentanyl overdose.\n\nShe was 20 years old.\n\nDescribing the last eight years without her, Doug said, “There is no worse pain.”\n\nYet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end stigma and change laws.\n\nHe told us he wants to “start the journey towards America’s recovery.”\n\nDoug, we’re with you.\n\nFentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.\n\nLet’s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production, sale, and trafficking, with more drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and powder at the border.\n\nWorking with couriers like Fed Ex to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.\n\nSecond, let’s do more on mental health, especially for our children. When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at school.\n\nWe must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit.\n\nAnd it’s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us.\n\nThird, let’s do more to keep our nation’s one truly sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home.\n\nJob training and job placement for veterans and their spouses as they return to civilian life.\n\nHelping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it.\n\nAnd we cannot go on losing 17 veterans a day to the silent scourge of suicide.\n\nThe VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they’re going through and get the help they need.\n\nAnd fourth, last year Jill and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead in our Administration.\n\nOur goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years. Turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. And provide more support for patients and families.\n\nIt’s personal for so many of us.\n\nJoining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama.\n\nThey met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I did.\n\nKindred spirits.\n\nHe wrote us a letter about their little daughter Ava.\n\nShe was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney cancer.\n\n26 blood transfusions. 11 rounds of radiation. 8 rounds of chemo. 1 kidney removed.\n\nA 5% survival rate.\n\nHe wrote how in the darkest moments he thought, “if she goes, I can’t stay.”\n\nJill and I understand, like so many of you.\n\nThey read how Jill described our family’s cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where you can.\n\nFor them, that glimmer of joy was a half-smile from their baby girl. It meant everything.\n\nThey never gave up hope.\n\nAva never gave up hope.
