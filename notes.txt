Notes:

Changes to RAGAS library were needed because its current adaptation (v 0.1.15 as shown on install, but I think I downloaded 0.1.14, as 0.1.15 isn't available as of 8/16/24) was not compatible with Google Gemini. Namely, they included the temperature variable in the LangChainLLM (BaseRagasLLM) class that Gemini does not use it. See the following pull request/files:

https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pull/657

To resolve this, I cloned the RAGAS library locally, then edited src/ragas/llms/base.py, tests/conftest.py, and tests/unit/llms/test_llm.py to not include references to 'temperature'. I then 'python -m pip install -e ./ragas_location' to install it locally in editable mode, which means that any other changes needed to the library to get it to work would be reflected in the installation immediately.

testset_answer_newcontext_flash_pro15.csv : Synthetically generated testset with RAGAS, with the addition of answers generated by Gemini 1.5 Flash along with the context used to create those answers. The 'context_gt' column contains the original contexts used to generate the 'ground_truth' column, all of which was created with the RAGAS TestsetGenerator.

testset_flash_pro15.csv : Synthetically generated testset with RAGAS's TestsetGenerator method. Same as above csv but does not contain answers column.
