2	"State of the Union Address given by President Biden on February 7, 2023  Mr. Speaker. Madam Vice President. Our First Lady and Second Gentleman.  Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military.  Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court.  And you, my fellow Americans.  I start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working together.  I also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the first Black House Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries.  Congratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch McConnell.  And congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader, this time with an even bigger majority.  And I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi.  The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.  A story that is unique among all nations.  We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.  That is what we are doing again.  Two years ago, our economy was reeling.  As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.  Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.  Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.  And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.  Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.  As we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.  You know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together.  But over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.  Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone.  But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.  Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.  Came together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people.  Came together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.  In fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.  To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress.  The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.  And that’s always been my vision for our country.  To restore the soul of the nation.  To rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class.  To unite the country.  We’ve been sent here to finish the job.  For decades, the middle class was hollowed out.  Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down.  Once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.  And along the way, something else was lost.  Pride. That sense of self-worth.  I ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.  To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.  As my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey –it’s going to be OK,” and mean it.  So, let’s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.  We’ve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.  Where is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again?  For too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs.  Now, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs.  Inflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies.  But we’re better positioned than any country on Earth.  We have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.  Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.  Food inflation is coming down.  Inflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up.  Additionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small business.  Every time somebody starts a small business, it’s an act of hope.  And the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted.  Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibility.  Semiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more. These chips were invented right here in America.  America used to make nearly 40% of the world’s chips.  But in the last few decades, we lost our edge and we’re down to producing only 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut down.  Today’s automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers couldn’t make enough cars because there weren’t enough chips.  Car prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones.  We can never let that happen again.  That’s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.  We’re making sure the supply chain for America begins in America.  We’ve already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law.  With this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country.  That’s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years.  Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres – a literal field of dreams.  That’ll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.  Jobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don’t require a college degree.  Jobs where people don’t have to leave home in search of opportunity.  And it’s just getting started.  Think about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that will come to life.  Talk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they’ll tell you what this means to their communities.  We’re seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland.  But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best infrastructure in the world.  We used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th.  Now we’re coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.  Already, we’ve funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland.  These projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and high-speed internet across America.  Urban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal.  And we’re just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law.  And to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don’t worry.  I promised to be the president for all Americans.  We’ll fund your projects. And I’ll see you at the ground-breaking.  This law will help further unite all of America.  Major projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs.  One of the nation’s most congested freight routes carrying $2 billion worth of freight every day. Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades, but we’re finally going to get it done.  I went there last month with Democrats and Republicans from both states to deliver $1.6 billion for this project.  While I was there, I met an ironworker named Sara, who is here tonight.  For 30 years, she’s been a proud member of Ironworkers Local 44, known as the “cowboys of the sky” who built the Cincinnati skyline.  Sara said she can’t wait to be ten stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. That’s pride.  That’s what we’re also building – Pride.  We’re also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers, so every child in America can drink clean water.  We’re making sure that every community has access to affordable, high-speed internet.  No parent should have to drive to a McDonald’s parking lot so their kid can do their homework online.  And when we do these projects, we’re going to Buy American.  Buy American has been the law of the land since 1933. But for too long, past administrations have found ways to get around it.  Not anymore.  Tonight, I’m also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.  American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables.  And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.  My economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible.  Maybe that’s you, watching at home.  You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.  I get it.  That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind.  Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.  For example, too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer, your child gets sick, or if something happens to you.  Will you have the money to pay your medical bills? Will you have to sell the house?  I get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we’re taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night.  You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth.  For example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.  Every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make.  But, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.  Not anymore.  We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.  But there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives.  Let’s finish the job this time.  Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it.  This law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year.  If drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the difference.  And we’re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn’t just save seniors money.  It will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare.  Why wouldn’t we want to do that?  Now, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.  Make no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it.  I’m pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in history.  A record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.  Thanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums.  But the way that law was written, that benefit expires after 2025.  Let’s finish the job, make those savings permanent, and expand coverage to those left off Medicaid.  Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis.  Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, and leading the world to a clean energy future.  I’ve visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts, storms and wildfires.  In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we are rebuilding for the long term.  New electric grids able to weather the next major storm.  Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood.  Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities too often left behind.  We’re building 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers.  And helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.  Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our lands.  Let’s face reality.  The climate crisis doesn’t care if your state is red or blue. It is an existential threat.  We have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I’m proud of how America is at last stepping up to the challenge.  But there’s so much more to do.  We will finish the job.  And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.  I’m a capitalist. But just pay your fair share.  And I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is simply unfair.  The idea that in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes?  That’s simply not fair.  But now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%.  Just 15%.  That’s less than a nurse pays. Let me be clear.  Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes.  Nobody. Not one penny.  But there’s more to do.  Let’s finish the job. Reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for a billionaire minimum tax.  Because no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.  You may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profits.  Last year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis.  It’s outrageous.  They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down.  Instead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.  Corporations ought to do the right thing.  That’s why I propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments instead.  They will still make a considerable profit.  Let’s finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes.  Instead of cutting the number of audits of wealthy tax payers, I signed a law that will reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats.  That’s being fiscally responsible.  In the last two years, my administration cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion – the largest deficit reduction in American history.  Under the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a 
row.  Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor.  Nearly 25% of the entire national debt, a debt that took 200 years to accumulate, was added by that administration alone.  How did Congress respond to all that debt?  They lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis.  They paid America’s bills to prevent economic disaster for our country.  Tonight, I’m asking this Congress to follow suit.  Let us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned.  Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what their plans are.  Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years.  That means if Congress doesn’t vote to keep them, those programs will go away.  Other Republicans say if we don’t cut Social Security and Medicare, they’ll let America default on its debt for the first time in our history.  I won’t let that happen.  Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors.  Americans have been paying into them with every single paycheck since they started working.  So tonight, let’s all agree to stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare.  Those benefits belong to the American people. They earned them.  If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.  I will not allow them to be taken away.  Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.  Next month when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to offer their plan.  We can sit down together and discuss both plans together.  My plan will lower the deficit by $2 trillion.  I won’t cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit.  In fact, I will extend the Medicare Trust Fund by at least two decades.  I will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. And I will pay for the ideas I’ve talked about tonight by making the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share.  Look, here’s the deal. Big corporations aren’t just taking advantage of the tax code. They’re taking advantage of you, the American consumer.  Here’s my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We’re already preventing insurance companies from sending surprise medical bills, stopping 1 million surprise bills a month.  We’re protecting seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.  Millions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get hearing aids over-the-counter without a prescription.  Capitalism without competition is not capitalism. It is exploitation.  Last year I cracked down on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for everyday goods coming into our country.  I signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90%, helping American farmers, businesses, and consumers.  Let’s finish the job.  Pass bipartisan legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage.  My administration is also taking on “junk” fees, those hidden surcharges too many businesses use to make you pay more.  For example, we’re making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront and refund your money if your flight is cancelled or delayed.  We’ve reduced exorbitant bank overdraft fees, saving consumers more than $1 billion a year.  We’re cutting credit card late fees by 75%, from $30 to $8.  Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month.  They make it harder for you to pay the bills or afford that family trip.  I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it.  Not anymore.  We’ve written a bill to stop all that. It’s called the Junk Fee Prevention Act.  We’ll ban surprise “resort fees” that hotels tack on to your bill. These fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren’t even resorts.  We’ll make cable internet and cellphone companies stop charging you up to $200 or more when you decide to switch to another provider.  We’ll cap service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all fees upfront.  And we’ll prohibit airlines from charging up to $50 roundtrip for families just to sit together.  Baggage fees are bad enough – they can’t just treat your child like a piece of luggage.  Americans are tired of being played for suckers.  Pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off.  For too long, workers have been getting stiffed.  Not anymore.  We’re beginning to restore the dignity of work.  For example, 30 million workers had to sign non-compete agreements when they took a job. So a cashier at a burger place can’t cross the street to take the same job at another burger place to make a couple bucks more.  Not anymore.  We’re banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they’re worth.  I’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing.  Pass the PRO Act because workers have a right to form a union. And let’s guarantee all workers a living wage.  Let’s also make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, and affordable child care that will enable millions more people to go to work.  Let’s also restore the full Child Tax Credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.  And by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity. We increase economic growth.  Let’s also finish the job and get more families access to affordable and quality housing.  Let’s get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. And give a little more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones.  Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing God’s work.  These plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do them.  Restoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class.  When we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.  But the world has caught up.  Jill, who teaches full-time, has an expression: “Any nation that out-educates us will out-compete us.”  Folks, you all know 12 years is not enough to win the economic competition for the 21st Century.  If you want America to have the best-educated workforce, let’s finish the job by providing access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds.  Studies show that children who go to pre-school are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their background.  Let’s give public school teachers a raise.  And we’re making progress by reducing student debt and increasing Pell Grants for working- and middle-class families.  Let’s finish the job, connect students to career opportunities starting in high school and provide two years of community college, some of the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree.  Let’s offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not.  And folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis when schools were closed, let’s also recognize how far we’ve come in the fight against the pandemic itself.  While the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people, we have broken COVID’s grip on us.  COVID deaths are down nearly 90%.  We’ve saved millions of lives and opened our country back up.  And soon we’ll end the public health emergency.  But we will remember the toll and pain that will never go away for so many. More than 1 million Americans have lost their lives to COVID.  Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table.  We remember them, and we remain vigilant.  We still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.  So Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe.  And as we emerge from this crisis stronger, I’m also doubling down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat during the pandemic.  Before I came to office many inspector generals who protect taxpayer dollars were sidelined. Fraud was rampant.  Last year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then, we’ve recovered billions of taxpayer dollars.  Now, let’s triple our anti-fraud strike forces going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars from the American people.  For every dollar we put into fighting fraud, taxpayers get back at least ten times as much.  COVID left other scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.  We have an obligation to make sure all our people are safe.  Public safety depends on public trust. But too often that trust is violated.  Joining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols, who had to bury him just last week. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a child.  But imagine what it’s like to lose a child at the hands of the law.  Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car.  I’ve never had to have the talk with my children – Beau, Hunter, and Ashley – that so many Black and Brown families have had with their children.  If a police officer pulls you over, turn on your interior lights. Don’t reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel.  Imagine having to worry like that every day in America.  Here’s what Tyre’s mom shared with me when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out.  With faith in God, she said her son “was a beautiful soul and something good will come from this.”  Imagine how much courage and character that takes.  It’s up to us. It’s up to all of us.  We all want the same thing.  Neighborhoods free of violence.  Law enforcement who earn the community’s trust.  Our children to come home safely.  Equal protection under the law; that’s the covenant we have with each other in America.  And we know police officers put their lives on the line every day, and we ask them to do too much.  To be counselors, social workers, psychologists; responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and more.  We ask too much of them.  I know most cops are good, decent people. They risk their lives every time they put on that shield.  But what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often.  We have to do better.  Give law enforcement the training they need, hold them to higher standards, and help them succeed in keeping everyone safe.  We also need more first responders and other professionals to address growing mental health and substance abuse challenges.  More resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime; more community intervention programs; more investments in housing, education, and job training.  All this can help prevent violence in the first place.  And when police officers or departments violate the public’s trust, we must hold them accountable.  With the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act.  Let’s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyre’s mother come true, something good must come from this.  All of us in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment.  We can’t turn away.  Let’s do what we know in our hearts we need to do.  Let’s come together and finish the job on police reform.  Do something.  That was the same plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde: Do something on gun violence.  Thank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.  That includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support, like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21-year-olds and red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others.  But we know our work is not done.  Joining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero.  Brandon put off his college dreams to stay by his mom’s side as she was dying from cancer. He now works at a dance studio started by his grandparents.  Two weeks ago, during Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio’s front door close and saw a man pointing a gun at him.  He thought he was going to die, but then he thought about the people inside.  In that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studio.  He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well.  Ban assault weapons once and for all.  We did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994.  In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled.  Let’s finish the job and ban assault weapons again.  And let’s also come together on immigration and make it a bipartisan issue like it was before.  We now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.  Since we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%.  But America’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts.  If you won’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.  Here in the people’s House, it’s our duty to protect all the people’s rights and freedoms.  Congress must restore the right the Supreme Court took away last year and codify Roe v. Wade to protect every woman’s constitutional right to choose.  The Vice President and I are doing everything we can to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy. But already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans.  Make no mistake; if Congress passes a national abortion ban, I will veto it.  Let’s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity.  Our strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example. Let’s remember the world is watching.  I spoke from this chamber one year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal war against Ukraine.  A murderous assault, evoking images of the death and destruction Europe suffered in World War II.  Putin’s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America. A test for the world.  Would we stand for the most basic of principles?  Would we stand for sovereignty?  Would we stand for the right of people to live free from tyranny?  Would we stand for the defense of democracy?  For such a defense matters to us because it keeps the peace and prevents open season for would-be aggressors to threaten our security and prosperity. One year later, we know the answer.  Yes, we would.  And yes, we did.  Together, we did what America always does at our best.  We led.  We united NATO and built a global coalition.  We stood against Putin’s aggression.  We stood with the Ukrainian people.  Tonight, we are once again joined by Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States. She represents not just her nation, but the courage of her people.  Ambassador, America is united in our support for your country. We will stand with you as long as it takes.  Our nation is working for more freedom, 
more dignity, and more peace, not just in Europe, but everywhere.  Before I came to office, the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was falling in the world.  Not anymore.  I’ve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict.  I will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China’s government is intent on dominating.  Investing in our alliances and working with our allies to protect our advanced technologies so they’re not used against us.  Modernizing our military to safeguard stability and deter aggression.  Today, we’re in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world.  I am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world.  But make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China’s threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.  And let’s be clear: winning the competition with China should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world.  But in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker.  Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.  America is rallying the world again to meet those challenges, from climate and global health, to food insecurity, to terrorism and territorial aggression.  Allies are stepping up, spending more and doing more.  And bridges are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic. And those who bet against America are learning just how wrong they are.  It’s never a good bet to bet against America.  When I came to office, most everyone assumed bipartisanship was impossible. But I never believed it.  That’s why a year ago, I offered a Unity Agenda for the nation.  We’ve made real progress.  Together, we passed a law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction.  Passed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental health.  Launched ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and so much more.  We passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named for the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year.  But there is so much more to do. And we can do it together.  Joining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire.  He wrote Jill and me a letter about his daughter Courtney. Contagious laugh. Her sister’s best friend.  He shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans.  Courtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually her death from a fentanyl overdose.  She was 20 years old.  Describing the last eight years without her, Doug said, “There is no worse pain.”  Yet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end stigma and change laws.  He told us he wants to “start the journey towards America’s recovery.”  Doug, we’re with you.  Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.  Let’s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production, sale, and trafficking, with more drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and powder at the border.  Working with couriers like Fed Ex to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.  Second, let’s do more on mental health, especially for our children. When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at school.  We must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit.  And it’s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us.  Third, let’s do more to keep our nation’s one truly sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home.  Job training and job placement for veterans and their spouses as they return to civilian life.  Helping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it.  And we cannot go on losing 17 veterans a day to the silent scourge of suicide.  The VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they’re going through and get the help they need.  And fourth, last year Jill and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead in our Administration.  Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years. Turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. And provide more support for patients and families.  It’s personal for so many of us.  Joining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama.  They met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I did.  Kindred spirits.  He wrote us a letter about their little daughter Ava.  She was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney cancer.  26 blood transfusions. 11 rounds of radiation. 8 rounds of chemo. 1 kidney removed.  A 5% survival rate.  He wrote how in the darkest moments he thought, “if she goes, I can’t stay.”  Jill and I understand, like so many of you.  They read how Jill described our family’s cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where you can.  For them, that glimmer of joy was a half-smile from their baby girl. It meant everything.  They never gave up hope.  Ava never gave up hope. She turns four next month.  They just found out that Ava beat the odds and is on her way to being cancer free, and she’s watching from the White House tonight.  For the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big things.  Twenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It’s been a huge success.  I believe we can do the same with cancer.  Let’s end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.  There’s one reason why we’re able to do all of these things: our democracy itself.  It’s the most fundamental thing of all.  With democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is.  For the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk.  Put to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th.  And then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of Representatives. Using the very same language that insurrectionists who stalked these halls chanted on January 6th.  Here tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get.  My friend, Paul Pelosi.  But such a heinous act never should have happened.  We must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. In America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right. We honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy.  And we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.  Democracy must not be a partisan issue. It must be an American issue.  Every generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called on to protect our democracy, to defend it, to stand up for it.  And this is our moment.  My fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to come.  We are not bystanders to history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power, of We the People. We are facing the test of our time and the time for choosing is at hand.  We must be the nation we have always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful. Forward-looking.  A nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos.  We must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea.  That all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities.  So I have come here to fulfil my constitutional duty to report on the state of the union. And here is my report.  Because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong.  As I stand here tonight, I have never been more optimistic about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are.  We are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.  May God bless you all. May God protect our troops."	"Who are the individuals addressed by the President in the beginning of his speech?

2	"State of the Union Address given by President Biden on February 7, 2023  Mr. Speaker. Madam Vice President. Our First Lady and Second Gentleman.  Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military.  Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court.  And you, my fellow Americans.  I start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working together.  I also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the first Black House Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries.  Congratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch McConnell.  And congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader, this time with an even bigger majority.  And I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi.  The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.  A story that is unique among all nations.  We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.  That is what we are doing again.  Two years ago, our economy was reeling.  As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.  Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.  Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.  And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.  Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.  As we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.  You know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together.  But over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.  Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone.  But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.  Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.  Came together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people.  Came together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.  In fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.  To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress.  The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.  And that’s always been my vision for our country.  To restore the soul of the nation.  To rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class.  To unite the country.  We’ve been sent here to finish the job.  For decades, the middle class was hollowed out.  Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down.  Once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.  And along the way, something else was lost.  Pride. That sense of self-worth.  I ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.  To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.  As my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey –it’s going to be OK,” and mean it.  So, let’s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.  We’ve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.  Where is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again?  For too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs.  Now, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs.  Inflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies.  But we’re better positioned than any country on Earth.  We have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.  Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.  Food inflation is coming down.  Inflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up.  Additionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small business.  Every time somebody starts a small business, it’s an act of hope.  And the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted.  Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibility.  Semiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more. These chips were invented right here in America.  America used to make nearly 40% of the world’s chips.  But in the last few decades, we lost our edge and we’re down to producing only 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut down.  Today’s automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers couldn’t make enough cars because there weren’t enough chips.  Car prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones.  We can never let that happen again.  That’s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.  We’re making sure the supply chain for America begins in America.  We’ve already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law.  With this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country.  That’s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years.  Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres – a literal field of dreams.  That’ll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.  Jobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don’t require a college degree.  Jobs where people don’t have to leave home in search of opportunity.  And it’s just getting started.  Think about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that will come to life.  Talk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they’ll tell you what this means to their communities.  We’re seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland.  But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best infrastructure in the world.  We used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th.  Now we’re coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.  Already, we’ve funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland.  These projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and high-speed internet across America.  Urban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal.  And we’re just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law.  And to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don’t worry.  I promised to be the president for all Americans.  We’ll fund your projects. And I’ll see you at the ground-breaking.  This law will help further unite all of America.  Major projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs.  One of the nation’s most congested freight routes carrying $2 billion worth of freight every day. Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades, but we’re finally going to get it done.  I went there last month with Democrats and Republicans from both states to deliver $1.6 billion for this project.  While I was there, I met an ironworker named Sara, who is here tonight.  For 30 years, she’s been a proud member of Ironworkers Local 44, known as the “cowboys of the sky” who built the Cincinnati skyline.  Sara said she can’t wait to be ten stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. That’s pride.  That’s what we’re also building – Pride.  We’re also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers, so every child in America can drink clean water.  We’re making sure that every community has access to affordable, high-speed internet.  No parent should have to drive to a McDonald’s parking lot so their kid can do their homework online.  And when we do these projects, we’re going to Buy American.  Buy American has been the law of the land since 1933. But for too long, past administrations have found ways to get around it.  Not anymore.  Tonight, I’m also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.  American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables.  And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.  My economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible.  Maybe that’s you, watching at home.  You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.  I get it.  That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind.  Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.  For example, too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer, your child gets sick, or if something happens to you.  Will you have the money to pay your medical bills? Will you have to sell the house?  I get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we’re taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night.  You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth.  For example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.  Every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make.  But, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.  Not anymore.  We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.  But there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives.  Let’s finish the job this time.  Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it.  This law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year.  If drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the difference.  And we’re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn’t just save seniors money.  It will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare.  Why wouldn’t we want to do that?  Now, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.  Make no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it.  I’m pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in history.  A record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.  Thanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums.  But the way that law was written, that benefit expires after 2025.  Let’s finish the job, make those savings permanent, and expand coverage to those left off Medicaid.  Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis.  Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, and leading the world to a clean energy future.  I’ve visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts, storms and wildfires.  In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we are rebuilding for the long term.  New electric grids able to weather the next major storm.  Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood.  Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities too often left behind.  We’re building 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers.  And helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.  Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our lands.  Let’s face reality.  The climate crisis doesn’t care if your state is red or blue. It is an existential threat.  We have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I’m proud of how America is at last stepping up to the challenge.  But there’s so much more to do.  We will finish the job.  And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.  I’m a capitalist. But just pay your fair share.  And I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is simply unfair.  The idea that in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes?  That’s simply not fair.  But now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%.  Just 15%.  That’s less than a nurse pays. Let me be clear.  Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes.  Nobody. Not one penny.  But there’s more to do.  Let’s finish the job. Reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for a billionaire minimum tax.  Because no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.  You may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profits.  Last year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis.  It’s outrageous.  They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down.  Instead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.  Corporations ought to do the right thing.  That’s why I propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments instead.  They will still make a considerable profit.  Let’s finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes.  Instead of cutting the number of audits of wealthy tax payers, I signed a law that will reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats.  That’s being fiscally responsible.  In the last two years, my administration cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion – the largest deficit reduction in American history.  Under the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a 
row.  Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor.  Nearly 25% of the entire national debt, a debt that took 200 years to accumulate, was added by that administration alone.  How did Congress respond to all that debt?  They lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis.  They paid America’s bills to prevent economic disaster for our country.  Tonight, I’m asking this Congress to follow suit.  Let us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned.  Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what their plans are.  Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years.  That means if Congress doesn’t vote to keep them, those programs will go away.  Other Republicans say if we don’t cut Social Security and Medicare, they’ll let America default on its debt for the first time in our history.  I won’t let that happen.  Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors.  Americans have been paying into them with every single paycheck since they started working.  So tonight, let’s all agree to stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare.  Those benefits belong to the American people. They earned them.  If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.  I will not allow them to be taken away.  Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.  Next month when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to offer their plan.  We can sit down together and discuss both plans together.  My plan will lower the deficit by $2 trillion.  I won’t cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit.  In fact, I will extend the Medicare Trust Fund by at least two decades.  I will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. And I will pay for the ideas I’ve talked about tonight by making the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share.  Look, here’s the deal. Big corporations aren’t just taking advantage of the tax code. They’re taking advantage of you, the American consumer.  Here’s my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We’re already preventing insurance companies from sending surprise medical bills, stopping 1 million surprise bills a month.  We’re protecting seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.  Millions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get hearing aids over-the-counter without a prescription.  Capitalism without competition is not capitalism. It is exploitation.  Last year I cracked down on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for everyday goods coming into our country.  I signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90%, helping American farmers, businesses, and consumers.  Let’s finish the job.  Pass bipartisan legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage.  My administration is also taking on “junk” fees, those hidden surcharges too many businesses use to make you pay more.  For example, we’re making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront and refund your money if your flight is cancelled or delayed.  We’ve reduced exorbitant bank overdraft fees, saving consumers more than $1 billion a year.  We’re cutting credit card late fees by 75%, from $30 to $8.  Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month.  They make it harder for you to pay the bills or afford that family trip.  I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it.  Not anymore.  We’ve written a bill to stop all that. It’s called the Junk Fee Prevention Act.  We’ll ban surprise “resort fees” that hotels tack on to your bill. These fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren’t even resorts.  We’ll make cable internet and cellphone companies stop charging you up to $200 or more when you decide to switch to another provider.  We’ll cap service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all fees upfront.  And we’ll prohibit airlines from charging up to $50 roundtrip for families just to sit together.  Baggage fees are bad enough – they can’t just treat your child like a piece of luggage.  Americans are tired of being played for suckers.  Pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off.  For too long, workers have been getting stiffed.  Not anymore.  We’re beginning to restore the dignity of work.  For example, 30 million workers had to sign non-compete agreements when they took a job. So a cashier at a burger place can’t cross the street to take the same job at another burger place to make a couple bucks more.  Not anymore.  We’re banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they’re worth.  I’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing.  Pass the PRO Act because workers have a right to form a union. And let’s guarantee all workers a living wage.  Let’s also make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, and affordable child care that will enable millions more people to go to work.  Let’s also restore the full Child Tax Credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.  And by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity. We increase economic growth.  Let’s also finish the job and get more families access to affordable and quality housing.  Let’s get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. And give a little more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones.  Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing God’s work.  These plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do them.  Restoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class.  When we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.  But the world has caught up.  Jill, who teaches full-time, has an expression: “Any nation that out-educates us will out-compete us.”  Folks, you all know 12 years is not enough to win the economic competition for the 21st Century.  If you want America to have the best-educated workforce, let’s finish the job by providing access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds.  Studies show that children who go to pre-school are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their background.  Let’s give public school teachers a raise.  And we’re making progress by reducing student debt and increasing Pell Grants for working- and middle-class families.  Let’s finish the job, connect students to career opportunities starting in high school and provide two years of community college, some of the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree.  Let’s offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not.  And folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis when schools were closed, let’s also recognize how far we’ve come in the fight against the pandemic itself.  While the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people, we have broken COVID’s grip on us.  COVID deaths are down nearly 90%.  We’ve saved millions of lives and opened our country back up.  And soon we’ll end the public health emergency.  But we will remember the toll and pain that will never go away for so many. More than 1 million Americans have lost their lives to COVID.  Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table.  We remember them, and we remain vigilant.  We still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.  So Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe.  And as we emerge from this crisis stronger, I’m also doubling down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat during the pandemic.  Before I came to office many inspector generals who protect taxpayer dollars were sidelined. Fraud was rampant.  Last year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then, we’ve recovered billions of taxpayer dollars.  Now, let’s triple our anti-fraud strike forces going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars from the American people.  For every dollar we put into fighting fraud, taxpayers get back at least ten times as much.  COVID left other scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.  We have an obligation to make sure all our people are safe.  Public safety depends on public trust. But too often that trust is violated.  Joining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols, who had to bury him just last week. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a child.  But imagine what it’s like to lose a child at the hands of the law.  Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car.  I’ve never had to have the talk with my children – Beau, Hunter, and Ashley – that so many Black and Brown families have had with their children.  If a police officer pulls you over, turn on your interior lights. Don’t reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel.  Imagine having to worry like that every day in America.  Here’s what Tyre’s mom shared with me when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out.  With faith in God, she said her son “was a beautiful soul and something good will come from this.”  Imagine how much courage and character that takes.  It’s up to us. It’s up to all of us.  We all want the same thing.  Neighborhoods free of violence.  Law enforcement who earn the community’s trust.  Our children to come home safely.  Equal protection under the law; that’s the covenant we have with each other in America.  And we know police officers put their lives on the line every day, and we ask them to do too much.  To be counselors, social workers, psychologists; responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and more.  We ask too much of them.  I know most cops are good, decent people. They risk their lives every time they put on that shield.  But what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often.  We have to do better.  Give law enforcement the training they need, hold them to higher standards, and help them succeed in keeping everyone safe.  We also need more first responders and other professionals to address growing mental health and substance abuse challenges.  More resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime; more community intervention programs; more investments in housing, education, and job training.  All this can help prevent violence in the first place.  And when police officers or departments violate the public’s trust, we must hold them accountable.  With the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act.  Let’s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyre’s mother come true, something good must come from this.  All of us in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment.  We can’t turn away.  Let’s do what we know in our hearts we need to do.  Let’s come together and finish the job on police reform.  Do something.  That was the same plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde: Do something on gun violence.  Thank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.  That includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support, like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21-year-olds and red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others.  But we know our work is not done.  Joining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero.  Brandon put off his college dreams to stay by his mom’s side as she was dying from cancer. He now works at a dance studio started by his grandparents.  Two weeks ago, during Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio’s front door close and saw a man pointing a gun at him.  He thought he was going to die, but then he thought about the people inside.  In that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studio.  He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well.  Ban assault weapons once and for all.  We did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994.  In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled.  Let’s finish the job and ban assault weapons again.  And let’s also come together on immigration and make it a bipartisan issue like it was before.  We now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.  Since we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%.  But America’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts.  If you won’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.  Here in the people’s House, it’s our duty to protect all the people’s rights and freedoms.  Congress must restore the right the Supreme Court took away last year and codify Roe v. Wade to protect every woman’s constitutional right to choose.  The Vice President and I are doing everything we can to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy. But already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans.  Make no mistake; if Congress passes a national abortion ban, I will veto it.  Let’s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity.  Our strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example. Let’s remember the world is watching.  I spoke from this chamber one year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal war against Ukraine.  A murderous assault, evoking images of the death and destruction Europe suffered in World War II.  Putin’s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America. A test for the world.  Would we stand for the most basic of principles?  Would we stand for sovereignty?  Would we stand for the right of people to live free from tyranny?  Would we stand for the defense of democracy?  For such a defense matters to us because it keeps the peace and prevents open season for would-be aggressors to threaten our security and prosperity. One year later, we know the answer.  Yes, we would.  And yes, we did.  Together, we did what America always does at our best.  We led.  We united NATO and built a global coalition.  We stood against Putin’s aggression.  We stood with the Ukrainian people.  Tonight, we are once again joined by Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States. She represents not just her nation, but the courage of her people.  Ambassador, America is united in our support for your country. We will stand with you as long as it takes.  Our nation is working for more freedom, 
more dignity, and more peace, not just in Europe, but everywhere.  Before I came to office, the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was falling in the world.  Not anymore.  I’ve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict.  I will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China’s government is intent on dominating.  Investing in our alliances and working with our allies to protect our advanced technologies so they’re not used against us.  Modernizing our military to safeguard stability and deter aggression.  Today, we’re in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world.  I am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world.  But make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China’s threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.  And let’s be clear: winning the competition with China should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world.  But in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker.  Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.  America is rallying the world again to meet those challenges, from climate and global health, to food insecurity, to terrorism and territorial aggression.  Allies are stepping up, spending more and doing more.  And bridges are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic. And those who bet against America are learning just how wrong they are.  It’s never a good bet to bet against America.  When I came to office, most everyone assumed bipartisanship was impossible. But I never believed it.  That’s why a year ago, I offered a Unity Agenda for the nation.  We’ve made real progress.  Together, we passed a law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction.  Passed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental health.  Launched ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and so much more.  We passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named for the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year.  But there is so much more to do. And we can do it together.  Joining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire.  He wrote Jill and me a letter about his daughter Courtney. Contagious laugh. Her sister’s best friend.  He shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans.  Courtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually her death from a fentanyl overdose.  She was 20 years old.  Describing the last eight years without her, Doug said, “There is no worse pain.”  Yet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end stigma and change laws.  He told us he wants to “start the journey towards America’s recovery.”  Doug, we’re with you.  Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.  Let’s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production, sale, and trafficking, with more drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and powder at the border.  Working with couriers like Fed Ex to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.  Second, let’s do more on mental health, especially for our children. When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at school.  We must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit.  And it’s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us.  Third, let’s do more to keep our nation’s one truly sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home.  Job training and job placement for veterans and their spouses as they return to civilian life.  Helping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it.  And we cannot go on losing 17 veterans a day to the silent scourge of suicide.  The VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they’re going through and get the help they need.  And fourth, last year Jill and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead in our Administration.  Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years. Turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. And provide more support for patients and families.  It’s personal for so many of us.  Joining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama.  They met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I did.  Kindred spirits.  He wrote us a letter about their little daughter Ava.  She was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney cancer.  26 blood transfusions. 11 rounds of radiation. 8 rounds of chemo. 1 kidney removed.  A 5% survival rate.  He wrote how in the darkest moments he thought, “if she goes, I can’t stay.”  Jill and I understand, like so many of you.  They read how Jill described our family’s cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where you can.  For them, that glimmer of joy was a half-smile from their baby girl. It meant everything.  They never gave up hope.  Ava never gave up hope. She turns four next month.  They just found out that Ava beat the odds and is on her way to being cancer free, and she’s watching from the White House tonight.  For the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big things.  Twenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It’s been a huge success.  I believe we can do the same with cancer.  Let’s end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.  There’s one reason why we’re able to do all of these things: our democracy itself.  It’s the most fundamental thing of all.  With democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is.  For the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk.  Put to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th.  And then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of Representatives. Using the very same language that insurrectionists who stalked these halls chanted on January 6th.  Here tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get.  My friend, Paul Pelosi.  But such a heinous act never should have happened.  We must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. In America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right. We honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy.  And we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.  Democracy must not be a partisan issue. It must be an American issue.  Every generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called on to protect our democracy, to defend it, to stand up for it.  And this is our moment.  My fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to come.  We are not bystanders to history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power, of We the People. We are facing the test of our time and the time for choosing is at hand.  We must be the nation we have always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful. Forward-looking.  A nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos.  We must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea.  That all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities.  So I have come here to fulfil my constitutional duty to report on the state of the union. And here is my report.  Because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong.  As I stand here tonight, I have never been more optimistic about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are.  We are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.  May God bless you all. May God protect our troops."	"Who are the individuals mentioned in the opening of the speech, and what are their respective roles? 
"	24.0	Yes	"President Biden begins his speech by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.  He also congratulates Hakeem Jeffries as the new leader of the House Democrats,  Mitch McConnell as the longest-serving Senate Leader in history, and Chuck Schumer as the Senate Majority Leader.

1	"State of the Union Address given by President Biden on March 1, 2022  Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.    Last year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again.   Tonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans.   With a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution.   And with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny.   Six days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated.   He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined.   He met the Ukrainian people.   From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.   Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies. Everyone from students to retirees teachers turned soldiers defending their homeland.   In this struggle as President Zelenskyy said in his speech to the European Parliament “Light will win over darkness.” The Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States is here tonight.   Let each of us here tonight in this Chamber send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world.   Please rise if you are able and show that, Yes, we the United States of America stand with the Ukrainian people.   Throughout our history we’ve learned this lesson when dictators do not pay a price for their aggression they cause more chaos.     They keep moving.     And the costs and the threats to America and the world keep rising.     That’s why the NATO Alliance was created to secure peace and stability in Europe after World War 2.   The United States is a member along with 29 other nations.   It matters. American diplomacy matters. American resolve matters.   Putin’s latest attack on Ukraine was premeditated and unprovoked.   He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy.   He thought the West and NATO wouldn’t respond. And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.  Here is what we did.     We prepared extensively and carefully.   We spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin.   I spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.    We countered Russia’s lies with truth.     And now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable.   Along with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.   We are inflicting pain on Russia and supporting the people of Ukraine. Putin is now isolated from the world more than ever.   Together with our allies –we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions.   We are cutting off Russia’s largest banks from the international financial system.    Preventing Russia’s central bank from defending the Russian Ruble making Putin’s $630 Billion “war fund” worthless.     We are choking off Russia’s access to technology that will sap its economic strength and weaken its military for years to come.    Tonight I say to the Russian oligarchs and corrupt leaders who have bilked billions of dollars off this violent regime no more.   The U.S. Department of Justice is assembling a dedicated task force to go after the crimes of Russian oligarchs.    We are joining with our European allies to find and seize your yachts your luxury apartments your private jets. We are coming for your ill-begotten gains.   And tonight I am announcing that we will join our allies in closing off American air space to all Russian flights – further isolating Russia – and adding an additional squeeze –on their economy. The Ruble has lost 30% of its value.   The Russian stock market has lost 40% of its value and trading remains suspended. Russia’s economy is reeling and Putin alone is to blame.   Together with our allies we are providing support to the Ukrainians in their fight for freedom. Military assistance. Economic assistance. Humanitarian assistance.   We are giving more than $1 Billion in direct assistance to Ukraine.   And we will continue to aid the Ukrainian people as they defend their country and to help ease their suffering.    Let me be clear, our forces are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine.    Our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine, but to defend our NATO Allies – in the event that Putin decides to keep moving west.    For that purpose we’ve mobilized American ground forces, air squadrons, and ship deployments to protect NATO countries including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia.   As I have made crystal clear the United States and our Allies will defend every inch of territory of NATO countries with the full force of our collective power.    And we remain clear-eyed. The Ukrainians are fighting back with pure courage. But the next few days weeks, months, will be hard on them.    Putin has unleashed violence and chaos.  But while he may make gains on the battlefield – he will pay a continuing high price over the long run.   And a proud Ukrainian people, who have known 30 years  of independence, have repeatedly shown that they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards.    To all Americans, I will be honest with you, as I’ve always promised. A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.   And I’m taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted at Russia’s economy. And I will use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.   Tonight, I can announce that the United States has worked with 30 other countries to release 60 Million barrels of oil from reserves around the world.    America will lead that effort, releasing 30 Million barrels from our own Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And we stand ready to do more if necessary, unified with our allies.    These steps will help blunt gas prices here at home. And I know the news about what’s happening can seem alarming.   But I want you to know that we are going to be okay.   When the history of this era is written Putin’s war on Ukraine will have left Russia weaker and the rest of the world stronger.   While it shouldn’t have taken something so terrible for people around the world to see what’s at stake now everyone sees it clearly.   We see the unity among leaders of nations and a more unified Europe a more unified West. And we see unity among the people who are gathering in cities in large crowds around the world even in Russia to demonstrate their support for Ukraine.    In the battle between democracy and autocracy, democracies are rising to the moment, and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security.   This is a real test. It’s going to take time. So let us continue to draw inspiration from the iron will of the Ukrainian people.   To our fellow Ukrainian Americans who forge a deep bond that connects our two nations we stand with you.   Putin may circle Kyiv with tanks, but he will never gain the hearts and souls of the Ukrainian people.   He will never extinguish their love of freedom. He will never weaken the resolve of the free world.   We meet tonight in an America that has lived through two of the hardest years this nation has ever faced.   The pandemic has been punishing.   And so many families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep up with the rising cost of food, gas, housing, and so much more.   I understand.   I remember when my Dad had to leave our home in Scranton, Pennsylvania to find work. I grew up in a family where if the price of food went up, you felt it.   That’s why one of the first things I did as President was fight to pass the American Rescue Plan.    Because people were hurting. We needed to act, and we did.   Few pieces of legislation have done more in a critical moment in our history to lift us out of crisis.   It fueled our efforts to vaccinate the nation and combat COVID-19. It delivered immediate economic relief for tens of millions of Americans.    Helped put food on their table, keep a roof over their heads, and cut the cost of health insurance.   And as my Dad used to say, it gave people a little breathing room.   And unlike the $2 Trillion tax cut passed in the previous administration that benefitted the top 1% of Americans, the American Rescue Plan helped working people—and left no one behind.   And it worked. It created jobs. Lots of jobs.   In fact—our economy created over 6.5 Million new jobs just last year, more jobs created in one year   than ever before in the history of America.   Our economy grew at a rate of 5.7% last year, the strongest growth in nearly 40 years, the first step in bringing fundamental change to an economy that hasn’t worked for the working people of this nation for too long.    For the past 40 years we were told that if we gave tax breaks to those at the very top, the benefits would trickle down to everyone else.   But that trickle-down theory led to weaker economic growth, lower wages, bigger deficits, and the widest gap between those at the top and everyone else in nearly a century.   Vice President Harris and I ran for office with a new economic vision for America.   Invest in America. Educate Americans. Grow the workforce. Build the economy from the bottom up   and the middle out, not from the top down.    Because we know that when the middle class grows, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy do very well.   America used to have the best roads, bridges, and airports on Earth.   Now our infrastructure is ranked 13th in the world.   We won’t be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st Century if we don’t fix that.   That’s why it was so important to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law—the most sweeping investment to rebuild America in history.   This was a bipartisan effort, and I want to thank the members of both parties who worked to make it happen.   We’re done talking about infrastructure weeks.   We’re going to have an infrastructure decade.   It is going to transform America and put us on a path to win the economic competition of the 21st Century that we face with the rest of the world—particularly with China.    As I’ve told Xi Jinping, it is never a good bet to bet against the American people.   We’ll create good jobs for millions of Americans, modernizing roads, airports, ports, and waterways all across America.   And we’ll do it all to withstand the devastating effects of the climate crisis and promote environmental justice.   We’ll build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations, begin to replace poisonous lead pipes—so every child—and every American—has clean water to drink at home and at school, provide affordable high-speed internet for every American—urban, suburban, rural, and tribal communities.   4,000 projects have already been announced.   And tonight, I’m announcing that this year we will start fixing over 65,000 miles of highway and 1,500 bridges in disrepair.   When we use taxpayer dollars to rebuild America – we are going to Buy American: buy American products to support American jobs.   The federal government spends about $600 Billion a year to keep the country safe and secure.   There’s been a law on the books for almost a century  to make sure taxpayers’ dollars support American jobs and businesses.   Every Administration says they’ll do it, but we are actually doing it.   We will buy American to make sure everything from the deck of an aircraft carrier to the steel on highway guardrails are made in America.   But to compete for the best jobs of the future, we also need to level the playing field with China and other competitors.   That’s why it is so important to pass the Bipartisan Innovation Act sitting in Congress that will make record investments in emerging technologies and American manufacturing.   Let me give you one example of why it’s so important to pass it.   If you travel 20 miles east of Columbus, Ohio, you’ll find 1,000 empty acres of land.   It won’t look like much, but if you stop and look closely, you’ll see a “Field of dreams,” the ground on which America’s future will be built.   This is where Intel, the American company that helped build Silicon Valley, is going to build its $20 billion semiconductor “mega site”.   Up to eight state-of-the-art factories in one place. 10,000 new good-paying jobs.   Some of the most sophisticated manufacturing in the world to make computer chips the size of a fingertip that power the world and our everyday lives.   Smartphones. The Internet. Technology we have yet to invent.   But that’s just the beginning.   Intel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from   $20 billion to $100 billion.   That would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history.   And all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill.   So let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it.    And we will really take off.   And Intel is not alone.   There’s something happening in America.   Just look around and you’ll see an amazing story.   The rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.” The revitalization of American manufacturing.     Companies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas.   That’s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country.   GM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan.   All told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year.   Powered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight.   As Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.”   It’s time.   But with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.    Inflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel.   I get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control.   Look, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories.   The pandemic also disrupted global supply chains.   When factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up.   Look at cars.   Last year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy.   And guess what, prices of automobiles went up.   So—we have a choice.   One way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.    I have a better plan to fight inflation.   Lower your costs, not your wages.   Make more cars and semiconductors in America.   More infrastructure and innovation in America.   More goods moving faster and cheaper in America.   More jobs where you can earn a good living in America.   And instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America.   Economists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.”   I call it building a better America.   My plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit.   17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan:   First – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.    He and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.    But drug companies charge families like 
Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom.   Imagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.    What it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be.   Joshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.    For Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.    Drug companies will still do very well. And while we’re at it let Medicare negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs, like the VA already does.   Look, the American Rescue Plan is helping millions of families on Affordable Care Act plans save $2,400 a year on their health care premiums. Let’s close the coverage gap and make those savings permanent.   Second – cut energy costs for families an average of $500 a year by combatting climate change.    Let’s provide investments and tax credits to weatherize your homes and businesses to be energy efficient and you get a tax credit; double America’s clean energy production in solar, wind, and so much more;  lower the price of electric vehicles, saving you another $80 a month because you’ll never have to pay at the gas pump again.   Third – cut the cost of child care. Many families pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child.    Middle-class and working families shouldn’t have to pay more than 7% of their income for care of young children.    My plan will cut the cost in half for most families and help parents, including millions of women, who left the workforce during the pandemic because they couldn’t afford child care, to be able to get back to work.   My plan doesn’t stop there. It also includes home and long-term care. More affordable housing. And Pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old.    All of these will lower costs.   And under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in new taxes. Nobody.    The one thing all Americans agree on is that the tax system is not fair. We have to fix it.    I’m not looking to punish anyone. But let’s make sure corporations and the wealthiest Americans start paying their fair share.   Just last year, 55 Fortune 500 corporations earned $40 billion in profits and paid zero dollars in federal income tax.    That’s simply not fair. That’s why I’ve proposed a 15% minimum tax rate for corporations.   We got more than 130 countries to agree on a global minimum tax rate so companies can’t get out of paying their taxes at home by shipping jobs and factories overseas.   That’s why I’ve proposed closing loopholes so the very wealthy don’t pay a lower tax rate than a teacher or a firefighter.    So that’s my plan. It will grow the economy and lower costs for families.   So what are we waiting for? Let’s get this done. And while you’re at it, confirm my nominees to the Federal Reserve, which plays a critical role in fighting inflation.    My plan will not only lower costs to give families a fair shot, it will lower the deficit.   The previous Administration not only ballooned the deficit with tax cuts for the very wealthy and corporations, it undermined the watchdogs whose job was to keep pandemic relief funds from being wasted.   But in my administration, the watchdogs have been welcomed back.   We’re going after the criminals who stole billions in relief money meant for small businesses and millions of Americans.    And tonight, I’m announcing that the Justice Department will name a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud.   By the end of this year, the deficit will be down to less than half what it was before I took office.    The only president ever to cut the deficit by more than one trillion dollars in a single year.   Lowering your costs also means demanding more competition.   I’m a capitalist, but capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism.   It’s exploitation—and it drives up prices.   When corporations don’t have to compete, their profits go up, your prices go up, and small businesses and family farmers and ranchers go under.   We see it happening with ocean carriers moving goods in and out of America.   During the pandemic, these foreign-owned companies raised prices by as much as 1,000% and made record profits.   Tonight, I’m announcing a crackdown on these companies overcharging American businesses and consumers.   And as Wall Street firms take over more nursing homes, quality in those homes has gone down and costs have gone up.    That ends on my watch.   Medicare is going to set higher standards for nursing homes and make sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and expect.   We’ll also cut costs and keep the economy going strong by giving workers a fair shot, provide more training and apprenticeships, hire them based on their skills not degrees.   Let’s pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and paid leave.    Raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and extend the Child Tax Credit, so no one has to raise a family in poverty.   Let’s increase Pell Grants and increase our historic support of HBCUs, and invest in what Jill—our First Lady who teaches full-time—calls America’s best-kept secret: community colleges.   And let’s pass the PRO Act when a majority of workers want to form a union—they shouldn’t be stopped.    When we invest in our workers, when we build the economy from the bottom up and the middle out together, we can do something we haven’t done in a long time: build a better America.   For more than two years, COVID-19 has impacted every decision in our lives and the life of the nation.   And I know you’re tired, frustrated, and exhausted.   But I also know this.   Because of the progress we’ve made, because of your resilience and the tools we have, tonight I can say   we are moving forward safely, back to more normal routines.    We’ve reached a new moment in the fight against COVID-19, with severe cases down to a level not seen since last July.    Just a few days ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—the CDC—issued new mask guidelines.   Under these new guidelines, most Americans in most of the country can now be mask free.     And based on the projections, more of the country will reach that point across the next couple of weeks.   Thanks to the progress we have made this past year, COVID-19 need no longer control our lives.    I know some are talking about “living with COVID-19”. Tonight – I say that we will never just accept living with COVID-19.   We will continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. And because this is a virus that mutates and spreads, we will stay on guard.   Here are four common sense steps as we move forward safely.    First, stay protected with vaccines and treatments. We know how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you’re vaccinated and boosted you have the highest degree of protection.   We will never give up on vaccinating more Americans. Now, I know parents with kids under 5 are eager to see a vaccine authorized for their children.   The scientists are working hard to get that done and we’ll be ready with plenty of vaccines when they do.   We’re also ready with anti-viral treatments. If you get COVID-19, the Pfizer pill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital by 90%.    We’ve ordered more of these pills than anyone in the world. And Pfizer is working overtime to get us 1 Million pills this month and more than double that next month.    And we’re launching the “Test to Treat” initiative so people can get tested at a pharmacy, and if they’re positive, receive antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.    If you’re immunocompromised or have some other vulnerability, we have treatments and free high-quality masks.   We’re leaving no one behind or ignoring anyone’s needs as we move forward.   And on testing, we have made hundreds of millions of tests available for you to order for free.     Even if you already ordered free tests tonight, I am announcing that you can order more from covidtests.gov starting next week.   Second – we must prepare for new variants. Over the past year, we’ve gotten much better at detecting new variants.   If necessary, we’ll be able to deploy new vaccines within 100 days instead of many more months or years.    And, if Congress provides the funds we need, we’ll have new stockpiles of tests, masks, and pills ready if needed.   I cannot promise a new variant won’t come. But I can promise you we’ll do everything within our power to be ready if it does.    Third – we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools we need.   It’s time for Americans to get back to work and fill our great downtowns again.  People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.     We’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person.   Our schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school.   And with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely.   We achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks.   Of course, continuing this costs money.   I will soon send Congress a request.   The vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.     Fourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.       We’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation.   And we won’t stop.   We have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life.   Let’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.    Let’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.    We can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together.   I recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera.   They were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun.   Officer Mora was 27 years old.   Officer Rivera was 22.   Both Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers.   I spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves.   I’ve worked on these issues a long time.   I know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.   So let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice.   Let’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.   That’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers.   That’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.    We should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities.   I ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.    And I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced.   And I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon?   Ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.   Repeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued.   These laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives.   The most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault.   In state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections.   We cannot let this happen.   Tonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections.   Tonight, I’d like to honor someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service.   One of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court.   And I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. One of our nation’s top legal minds, who will continue Justice Breyer’s legacy of excellence.   A former top litigator in private practice. A former federal public defender. And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder. Since she’s been nominated, she’s received a broad range of support—from the Fraternal Order of Police to former judges appointed by Democrats and Republicans.   And if we are to advance liberty and justice, we need to secure the Border and fix the immigration system.   We can do both. At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.    We’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.    We’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster.   We’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders.   We can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours.   Provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.   Revise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite.   It’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do.   That’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.   Let’s get it done once and for all.   Advancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women.   The constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before.   If we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America.   And for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong.   As I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.   While it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.   And soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.   So tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.    First, beat the opioid epidemic.   There is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.    Get rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from 
prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers.   If you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery.   Second, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.    The American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.    I urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.   Children were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.   As Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.   It’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.   And let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care.   Third, support our veterans.   Veterans are the best of us.   I’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home.   My administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.    Our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.   One was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more.   When they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same.   Headaches. Numbness. Dizziness.   A cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.   I know.   One of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.   We don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops.   But I’m committed to finding out everything we can.   Committed to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.   The widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.    He was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.   Stationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.   Heath’s widow Danielle is here with us tonight. They loved going to Ohio State football games. He loved building Legos with their daughter.   But cancer from prolonged exposure to burn pits ravaged Heath’s lungs and body.   Danielle says Heath was a fighter to the very end.   He didn’t know how to stop fighting, and neither did she.   Through her pain she found purpose to demand we do better.   Tonight, Danielle—we are.   The VA is pioneering new ways of linking toxic exposures to diseases, already helping more veterans get benefits.   And tonight, I’m announcing we’re expanding eligibility to veterans suffering from nine respiratory cancers.   I’m also calling on Congress: pass a law to make sure veterans devastated by toxic exposures in Iraq and Afghanistan finally get the benefits and comprehensive health care they deserve.   And fourth, let’s end cancer as we know it.   This is personal to me and Jill, to Kamala, and to so many of you.   Cancer is the #2 cause of death in America–second only to heart disease.   Last month, I announced our plan to supercharge   the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead six years ago.   Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years, turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases.    More support for patients and families.   To get there, I call on Congress to fund ARPA-H, the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.   It’s based on DARPA—the Defense Department project that led to the Internet, GPS, and so much more.    ARPA-H will have a singular purpose—to drive breakthroughs in cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and more.   A unity agenda for the nation.   We can do this.   My fellow Americans—tonight , we have gathered in a sacred space—the citadel of our democracy.   In this Capitol, generation after generation, Americans have debated great questions amid great strife, and have done great things.   We have fought for freedom, expanded liberty, defeated totalitarianism and terror.   And built the strongest, freest, and most prosperous nation the world has ever known.   Now is the hour.   Our moment of responsibility.   Our test of resolve and conscience, of history itself.   It is in this moment that our character is formed. Our purpose is found. Our future is forged.   Well I know this nation.    We will meet the test.   To protect freedom and liberty, to expand fairness and opportunity.   We will save democracy.   As hard as these times have been, I am more optimistic about America today than I have been my whole life.   Because I see the future that is within our grasp.   Because I know there is simply nothing beyond our capacity.   We are the only nation on Earth that has always turned every crisis we have faced into an opportunity.   The only nation that can be defined by a single word: possibilities.   So on this night, in our 245th year as a nation, I have come to report on the State of the Union.   And my report is this: the State of the Union is strong—because you, the American people, are strong.   We are stronger today than we were a year ago.   And we will be stronger a year from now than we are today.   Now is our moment to meet and overcome the challenges of our time.   And we will, as one people.   One America.   The United States of America.   May God bless you all. May God protect our troops."	"Who are the individuals addressed by the President in the beginning of his speech?

2	"State of the Union Address given by President Biden on February 7, 2023  Mr. Speaker. Madam Vice President. Our First Lady and Second Gentleman.  Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military.  Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court.  And you, my fellow Americans.  I start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working together.  I also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the first Black House Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries.  Congratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch McConnell.  And congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader, this time with an even bigger majority.  And I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi.  The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.  A story that is unique among all nations.  We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.  That is what we are doing again.  Two years ago, our economy was reeling.  As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.  Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.  Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.  And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.  Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.  As we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.  You know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together.  But over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.  Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone.  But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.  Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.  Came together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people.  Came together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.  In fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.  To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress.  The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.  And that’s always been my vision for our country.  To restore the soul of the nation.  To rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class.  To unite the country.  We’ve been sent here to finish the job.  For decades, the middle class was hollowed out.  Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down.  Once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.  And along the way, something else was lost.  Pride. That sense of self-worth.  I ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.  To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.  As my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey –it’s going to be OK,” and mean it.  So, let’s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.  We’ve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.  Where is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again?  For too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs.  Now, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs.  Inflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies.  But we’re better positioned than any country on Earth.  We have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.  Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.  Food inflation is coming down.  Inflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up.  Additionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small business.  Every time somebody starts a small business, it’s an act of hope.  And the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted.  Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibility.  Semiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more. These chips were invented right here in America.  America used to make nearly 40% of the world’s chips.  But in the last few decades, we lost our edge and we’re down to producing only 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut down.  Today’s automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers couldn’t make enough cars because there weren’t enough chips.  Car prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones.  We can never let that happen again.  That’s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.  We’re making sure the supply chain for America begins in America.  We’ve already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law.  With this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country.  That’s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years.  Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres – a literal field of dreams.  That’ll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.  Jobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don’t require a college degree.  Jobs where people don’t have to leave home in search of opportunity.  And it’s just getting started.  Think about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that will come to life.  Talk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they’ll tell you what this means to their communities.  We’re seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland.  But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best infrastructure in the world.  We used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th.  Now we’re coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.  Already, we’ve funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland.  These projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and high-speed internet across America.  Urban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal.  And we’re just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law.  And to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don’t worry.  I promised to be the president for all Americans.  We’ll fund your projects. And I’ll see you at the ground-breaking.  This law will help further unite all of America.  Major projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs.  One of the nation’s most congested freight routes carrying $2 billion worth of freight every day. Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades, but we’re finally going to get it done.  I went there last month with Democrats and Republicans from both states to deliver $1.6 billion for this project.  While I was there, I met an ironworker named Sara, who is here tonight.  For 30 years, she’s been a proud member of Ironworkers Local 44, known as the “cowboys of the sky” who built the Cincinnati skyline.  Sara said she can’t wait to be ten stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. That’s pride.  That’s what we’re also building – Pride.  We’re also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers, so every child in America can drink clean water.  We’re making sure that every community has access to affordable, high-speed internet.  No parent should have to drive to a McDonald’s parking lot so their kid can do their homework online.  And when we do these projects, we’re going to Buy American.  Buy American has been the law of the land since 1933. But for too long, past administrations have found ways to get around it.  Not anymore.  Tonight, I’m also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.  American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables.  And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.  My economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible.  Maybe that’s you, watching at home.  You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.  I get it.  That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind.  Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.  For example, too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer, your child gets sick, or if something happens to you.  Will you have the money to pay your medical bills? Will you have to sell the house?  I get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we’re taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night.  You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth.  For example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.  Every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make.  But, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.  Not anymore.  We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.  But there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives.  Let’s finish the job this time.  Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it.  This law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year.  If drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the difference.  And we’re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn’t just save seniors money.  It will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare.  Why wouldn’t we want to do that?  Now, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.  Make no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it.  I’m pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in history.  A record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.  Thanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums.  But the way that law was written, that benefit expires after 2025.  Let’s finish the job, make those savings permanent, and expand coverage to those left off Medicaid.  Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis.  Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, and leading the world to a clean energy future.  I’ve visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts, storms and wildfires.  In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we are rebuilding for the long term.  New electric grids able to weather the next major storm.  Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood.  Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities too often left behind.  We’re building 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers.  And helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.  Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our lands.  Let’s face reality.  The climate crisis doesn’t care if your state is red or blue. It is an existential threat.  We have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I’m proud of how America is at last stepping up to the challenge.  But there’s so much more to do.  We will finish the job.  And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.  I’m a capitalist. But just pay your fair share.  And I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is simply unfair.  The idea that in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes?  That’s simply not fair.  But now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%.  Just 15%.  That’s less than a nurse pays. Let me be clear.  Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes.  Nobody. Not one penny.  But there’s more to do.  Let’s finish the job. Reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for a billionaire minimum tax.  Because no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.  You may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profits.  Last year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis.  It’s outrageous.  They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down.  Instead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.  Corporations ought to do the right thing.  That’s why I propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments instead.  They will still make a considerable profit.  Let’s finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes.  Instead of cutting the number of audits of wealthy tax payers, I signed a law that will reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats.  That’s being fiscally responsible.  In the last two years, my administration cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion – the largest deficit reduction in American history.  Under the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a 
row.  Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor.  Nearly 25% of the entire national debt, a debt that took 200 years to accumulate, was added by that administration alone.  How did Congress respond to all that debt?  They lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis.  They paid America’s bills to prevent economic disaster for our country.  Tonight, I’m asking this Congress to follow suit.  Let us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned.  Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what their plans are.  Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years.  That means if Congress doesn’t vote to keep them, those programs will go away.  Other Republicans say if we don’t cut Social Security and Medicare, they’ll let America default on its debt for the first time in our history.  I won’t let that happen.  Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors.  Americans have been paying into them with every single paycheck since they started working.  So tonight, let’s all agree to stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare.  Those benefits belong to the American people. They earned them.  If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.  I will not allow them to be taken away.  Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.  Next month when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to offer their plan.  We can sit down together and discuss both plans together.  My plan will lower the deficit by $2 trillion.  I won’t cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit.  In fact, I will extend the Medicare Trust Fund by at least two decades.  I will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. And I will pay for the ideas I’ve talked about tonight by making the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share.  Look, here’s the deal. Big corporations aren’t just taking advantage of the tax code. They’re taking advantage of you, the American consumer.  Here’s my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We’re already preventing insurance companies from sending surprise medical bills, stopping 1 million surprise bills a month.  We’re protecting seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.  Millions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get hearing aids over-the-counter without a prescription.  Capitalism without competition is not capitalism. It is exploitation.  Last year I cracked down on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for everyday goods coming into our country.  I signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90%, helping American farmers, businesses, and consumers.  Let’s finish the job.  Pass bipartisan legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage.  My administration is also taking on “junk” fees, those hidden surcharges too many businesses use to make you pay more.  For example, we’re making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront and refund your money if your flight is cancelled or delayed.  We’ve reduced exorbitant bank overdraft fees, saving consumers more than $1 billion a year.  We’re cutting credit card late fees by 75%, from $30 to $8.  Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month.  They make it harder for you to pay the bills or afford that family trip.  I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it.  Not anymore.  We’ve written a bill to stop all that. It’s called the Junk Fee Prevention Act.  We’ll ban surprise “resort fees” that hotels tack on to your bill. These fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren’t even resorts.  We’ll make cable internet and cellphone companies stop charging you up to $200 or more when you decide to switch to another provider.  We’ll cap service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all fees upfront.  And we’ll prohibit airlines from charging up to $50 roundtrip for families just to sit together.  Baggage fees are bad enough – they can’t just treat your child like a piece of luggage.  Americans are tired of being played for suckers.  Pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off.  For too long, workers have been getting stiffed.  Not anymore.  We’re beginning to restore the dignity of work.  For example, 30 million workers had to sign non-compete agreements when they took a job. So a cashier at a burger place can’t cross the street to take the same job at another burger place to make a couple bucks more.  Not anymore.  We’re banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they’re worth.  I’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing.  Pass the PRO Act because workers have a right to form a union. And let’s guarantee all workers a living wage.  Let’s also make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, and affordable child care that will enable millions more people to go to work.  Let’s also restore the full Child Tax Credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.  And by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity. We increase economic growth.  Let’s also finish the job and get more families access to affordable and quality housing.  Let’s get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. And give a little more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones.  Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing God’s work.  These plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do them.  Restoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class.  When we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.  But the world has caught up.  Jill, who teaches full-time, has an expression: “Any nation that out-educates us will out-compete us.”  Folks, you all know 12 years is not enough to win the economic competition for the 21st Century.  If you want America to have the best-educated workforce, let’s finish the job by providing access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds.  Studies show that children who go to pre-school are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their background.  Let’s give public school teachers a raise.  And we’re making progress by reducing student debt and increasing Pell Grants for working- and middle-class families.  Let’s finish the job, connect students to career opportunities starting in high school and provide two years of community college, some of the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree.  Let’s offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not.  And folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis when schools were closed, let’s also recognize how far we’ve come in the fight against the pandemic itself.  While the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people, we have broken COVID’s grip on us.  COVID deaths are down nearly 90%.  We’ve saved millions of lives and opened our country back up.  And soon we’ll end the public health emergency.  But we will remember the toll and pain that will never go away for so many. More than 1 million Americans have lost their lives to COVID.  Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table.  We remember them, and we remain vigilant.  We still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.  So Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe.  And as we emerge from this crisis stronger, I’m also doubling down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat during the pandemic.  Before I came to office many inspector generals who protect taxpayer dollars were sidelined. Fraud was rampant.  Last year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then, we’ve recovered billions of taxpayer dollars.  Now, let’s triple our anti-fraud strike forces going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars from the American people.  For every dollar we put into fighting fraud, taxpayers get back at least ten times as much.  COVID left other scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.  We have an obligation to make sure all our people are safe.  Public safety depends on public trust. But too often that trust is violated.  Joining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols, who had to bury him just last week. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a child.  But imagine what it’s like to lose a child at the hands of the law.  Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car.  I’ve never had to have the talk with my children – Beau, Hunter, and Ashley – that so many Black and Brown families have had with their children.  If a police officer pulls you over, turn on your interior lights. Don’t reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel.  Imagine having to worry like that every day in America.  Here’s what Tyre’s mom shared with me when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out.  With faith in God, she said her son “was a beautiful soul and something good will come from this.”  Imagine how much courage and character that takes.  It’s up to us. It’s up to all of us.  We all want the same thing.  Neighborhoods free of violence.  Law enforcement who earn the community’s trust.  Our children to come home safely.  Equal protection under the law; that’s the covenant we have with each other in America.  And we know police officers put their lives on the line every day, and we ask them to do too much.  To be counselors, social workers, psychologists; responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and more.  We ask too much of them.  I know most cops are good, decent people. They risk their lives every time they put on that shield.  But what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often.  We have to do better.  Give law enforcement the training they need, hold them to higher standards, and help them succeed in keeping everyone safe.  We also need more first responders and other professionals to address growing mental health and substance abuse challenges.  More resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime; more community intervention programs; more investments in housing, education, and job training.  All this can help prevent violence in the first place.  And when police officers or departments violate the public’s trust, we must hold them accountable.  With the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act.  Let’s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyre’s mother come true, something good must come from this.  All of us in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment.  We can’t turn away.  Let’s do what we know in our hearts we need to do.  Let’s come together and finish the job on police reform.  Do something.  That was the same plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde: Do something on gun violence.  Thank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.  That includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support, like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21-year-olds and red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others.  But we know our work is not done.  Joining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero.  Brandon put off his college dreams to stay by his mom’s side as she was dying from cancer. He now works at a dance studio started by his grandparents.  Two weeks ago, during Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio’s front door close and saw a man pointing a gun at him.  He thought he was going to die, but then he thought about the people inside.  In that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studio.  He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well.  Ban assault weapons once and for all.  We did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994.  In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled.  Let’s finish the job and ban assault weapons again.  And let’s also come together on immigration and make it a bipartisan issue like it was before.  We now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.  Since we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%.  But America’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts.  If you won’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.  Here in the people’s House, it’s our duty to protect all the people’s rights and freedoms.  Congress must restore the right the Supreme Court took away last year and codify Roe v. Wade to protect every woman’s constitutional right to choose.  The Vice President and I are doing everything we can to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy. But already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans.  Make no mistake; if Congress passes a national abortion ban, I will veto it.  Let’s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity.  Our strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example. Let’s remember the world is watching.  I spoke from this chamber one year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal war against Ukraine.  A murderous assault, evoking images of the death and destruction Europe suffered in World War II.  Putin’s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America. A test for the world.  Would we stand for the most basic of principles?  Would we stand for sovereignty?  Would we stand for the right of people to live free from tyranny?  Would we stand for the defense of democracy?  For such a defense matters to us because it keeps the peace and prevents open season for would-be aggressors to threaten our security and prosperity. One year later, we know the answer.  Yes, we would.  And yes, we did.  Together, we did what America always does at our best.  We led.  We united NATO and built a global coalition.  We stood against Putin’s aggression.  We stood with the Ukrainian people.  Tonight, we are once again joined by Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States. She represents not just her nation, but the courage of her people.  Ambassador, America is united in our support for your country. We will stand with you as long as it takes.  Our nation is working for more freedom, 
more dignity, and more peace, not just in Europe, but everywhere.  Before I came to office, the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was falling in the world.  Not anymore.  I’ve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict.  I will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China’s government is intent on dominating.  Investing in our alliances and working with our allies to protect our advanced technologies so they’re not used against us.  Modernizing our military to safeguard stability and deter aggression.  Today, we’re in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world.  I am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world.  But make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China’s threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.  And let’s be clear: winning the competition with China should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world.  But in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker.  Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.  America is rallying the world again to meet those challenges, from climate and global health, to food insecurity, to terrorism and territorial aggression.  Allies are stepping up, spending more and doing more.  And bridges are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic. And those who bet against America are learning just how wrong they are.  It’s never a good bet to bet against America.  When I came to office, most everyone assumed bipartisanship was impossible. But I never believed it.  That’s why a year ago, I offered a Unity Agenda for the nation.  We’ve made real progress.  Together, we passed a law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction.  Passed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental health.  Launched ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and so much more.  We passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named for the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year.  But there is so much more to do. And we can do it together.  Joining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire.  He wrote Jill and me a letter about his daughter Courtney. Contagious laugh. Her sister’s best friend.  He shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans.  Courtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually her death from a fentanyl overdose.  She was 20 years old.  Describing the last eight years without her, Doug said, “There is no worse pain.”  Yet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end stigma and change laws.  He told us he wants to “start the journey towards America’s recovery.”  Doug, we’re with you.  Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.  Let’s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production, sale, and trafficking, with more drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and powder at the border.  Working with couriers like Fed Ex to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.  Second, let’s do more on mental health, especially for our children. When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at school.  We must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit.  And it’s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us.  Third, let’s do more to keep our nation’s one truly sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home.  Job training and job placement for veterans and their spouses as they return to civilian life.  Helping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it.  And we cannot go on losing 17 veterans a day to the silent scourge of suicide.  The VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they’re going through and get the help they need.  And fourth, last year Jill and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead in our Administration.  Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years. Turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. And provide more support for patients and families.  It’s personal for so many of us.  Joining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama.  They met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I did.  Kindred spirits.  He wrote us a letter about their little daughter Ava.  She was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney cancer.  26 blood transfusions. 11 rounds of radiation. 8 rounds of chemo. 1 kidney removed.  A 5% survival rate.  He wrote how in the darkest moments he thought, “if she goes, I can’t stay.”  Jill and I understand, like so many of you.  They read how Jill described our family’s cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where you can.  For them, that glimmer of joy was a half-smile from their baby girl. It meant everything.  They never gave up hope.  Ava never gave up hope. She turns four next month.  They just found out that Ava beat the odds and is on her way to being cancer free, and she’s watching from the White House tonight.  For the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big things.  Twenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It’s been a huge success.  I believe we can do the same with cancer.  Let’s end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.  There’s one reason why we’re able to do all of these things: our democracy itself.  It’s the most fundamental thing of all.  With democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is.  For the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk.  Put to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th.  And then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of Representatives. Using the very same language that insurrectionists who stalked these halls chanted on January 6th.  Here tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get.  My friend, Paul Pelosi.  But such a heinous act never should have happened.  We must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. In America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right. We honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy.  And we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.  Democracy must not be a partisan issue. It must be an American issue.  Every generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called on to protect our democracy, to defend it, to stand up for it.  And this is our moment.  My fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to come.  We are not bystanders to history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power, of We the People. We are facing the test of our time and the time for choosing is at hand.  We must be the nation we have always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful. Forward-looking.  A nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos.  We must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea.  That all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities.  So I have come here to fulfil my constitutional duty to report on the state of the union. And here is my report.  Because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong.  As I stand here tonight, I have never been more optimistic about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are.  We are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.  May God bless you all. May God protect our troops."	"Who are the individuals addressed by the President in the beginning of his speech? 
"	43.0	Yes	"President Biden begins his speech by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.  He also congratulates Hakeem Jeffries as the new leader of the House Democrats,  Mitch McConnell as the longest-serving Senate Leader in history, and Chuck Schumer as the Senate Majority Leader.  He then gives special recognition to Nancy Pelosi as the greatest Speaker in the history of the country.

0	"State of the Union Address given by President Biden on April 29, 2021  THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Good to be back.  And Mitch and Chuck will understand it’s good to be almost home, down the hall.  Anyway, thank you all.  Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President — (applause) — no President has ever said those words from this podium.  No President has ever said those words, and it’s about time.  (Applause.)  First Lady — (applause) — I’m her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different — a reminder of the extraordinary times we’re in.  Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to Congress, to the nation, and to the world to declare war, to celebrate peace, to announce new plans and possibilities.  Tonight, I come to talk about crisis and opportunity, about rebuilding the nation, revitalizing our democracy, and winning the future for America.  I stand here tonight, one day shy of the 100th day of my administration — 100 days since I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a nation — we all did — that was in crisis.  The worst pandemic in a century.  The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.  The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.  Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again — (applause) — turning peril into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setbacks into strength.  We all know life can knock us down.  But in America, we never, ever, ever stay down.  Americans always get up.  Today, that’s what we’re doing: America is rising anew, choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, and light over darkness.  After 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff, in my view.  We’re working again, dreaming again, discovering again, and leading the world again.  We have shown each other and the world that there’s no quit in America — none.  One hundred days ago, America’s house was on fire.  We had to act.  And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi; Malor- — Majority Leader Schumer; and the overwhelming support of the American people — Democrats, independents, and Republicans — we did act.  Together we passed the American Rescue Plan — one of the most consequential rescue packages in American history.  We’re already seeing the results.  (Applause.)   We’re already seeing the results.   After I promised we’d get 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into people’s arms in 100 days, we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days.  (Applause.)  Thanks to all the help of all of you, we’re marshalling — with your help, everyone’s help — we’re marshalling every federal resource.  We’ve gotten vaccines to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 Community Health Centers where the poorest of the poor can be reached.  We’re setting up community vaccination sites, developing mobile units to get to hard-to-reach communities.  Today, 90 percent of Americans now live within five miles of a vaccination site.  Everyone over the age of 16 — everyone is now eligible to get vaccinated right now, right away.  (Applause.)  Go get vaccinated, America.  Go and get the vaccination.  They’re available.  You’re eligible now.  When I was sworn in on January 20th, less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully vaccinated against COVID-19.  One hundred days later, 70 percent of seniors in America over 65 are protected — fully protected.    Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80 percent since January — down 80 percent because of all of you.  And more than half of all the adults in America have gotten at least one shot.  At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse — I said, “What’s it like?”  She looked at me and she said, “It’s like every shot is giving a dose of hope” — was the phrase.  “A dose of hope.”  A dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune disease — wrote to me, said she’s worried — that she was worrying about bringing the virus home.  She said she then got vaccinated at a — at a large site, in her car.  She said she sat in her car, when she got vaccinated, and just cried — cried out of joy and cried out of relief.  Parents see the smiles on their kids’ faces, for those who are able to go back to school because the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.  Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a window to say goodbye.  It means everything.  Those things mean everything.  You know, there’s still — you all know it; you know it better than any group of Americans — there’s still more work to do to beat this virus.  We can’t let our guard down.  But tonight I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical achievements — logistical achievements this country has ever seen.  What else have we done in those first 100 days?  We kept our commitment — Democrats and Republicans — of sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85 percent of American households.  We’ve already sent more than one — 160 million checks out the door.  It’s making the difference.  You all know it when you go home.  For many people, it’s making all the difference in the world.  A single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said she couldn’t work, but she said the relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment.  A grandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor — something she said she put off for months because she didn’t have the money.   One of the defining images, at least from my perspective, of this crisis has been cars lined up — cars lined up for miles.  And not — not people who just barely ever start those cars — nice cars lined up for miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.  I don’t know about you, but I didn’t ever think I’d see that in America.  And all of this is through no fault of their own.  No fault of their own these people are in this position.  That’s why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already.   We’re also providing rental assistance — you all know this, but the American people, I want to make sure they understand — keeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job.  During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act when I established the special sign-up period to do that — 800,000 in that period.  We’re making one of the largest one-time ever investments — ever — in improving healthcare for veterans.  Critical investments to address the opioid crisis.  And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we’re on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year.  (Applause.)  And in the process, while this was all going on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 new jobs in 100 days — more jobs in the first — (applause) — more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record.  The International Monetary Fund — (applause) — the International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 percent this year.  That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades.  America is moving — moving forward — but we can’t stop now.  We’re in competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century.  We’re at a great inflection point in history.  We have to do more than just build back better — I mean “build back.”  We have to build back better.  We have to compete more strenuously than we have.  Throughout our history, if you think about it, public investment and infrastructure has literally transformed America — our attitudes, as well as our opportunities.  The transcontinental railroad, the interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United States of America.  Universal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity.  Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon — now we’re on Mars; discovering vaccines; gave us the Internet and so much more.  These are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the government was in a position to make.  Time and again, they propel us into the future.  That’s why I proposed the American Jobs Plan — a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself.  This is the largest jobs plan since World War Two.  It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors, transit lines.   It’s clean water.  And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 schools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water — a clear and present danger to our children’s health.  The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American can drink clean water.  (Applause.)  And in the process, it will create thousands and thousands of good-paying jobs.  It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed Internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn’t have it.  This is going to help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st-century economy.  And I am asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would —  THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Of course.  THE PRESIDENT:  — because I know it will get done.  (Applause.)  It creates jobs, building a modern power grid.  Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, catastrophic failures — with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter storms.  The American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid.  We can do that.  (Applause.)  Look, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to their careers.  Two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic — two million.  And too often because they couldn’t get the care they needed to care for their child or care for an elderly parent who needs help.  Eight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability.  If you think it’s not important, check out in your own district.  Democrat or Republican — Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern — almost as much as their children — is taking care of an elderly loved one who can’t be left alone.  Medicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth.  For too long, we’ve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis: “jobs.”  Jobs.  Jobs.  (Applause.)   For me, when I think “climate change,” I think “jobs.”  The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy-efficient buildings and homes.  Electrical workers — IBEW members — installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways so we can own — (applause) — so we can own the electric car market.  (Applause.)  Farmers — farmers planting cover crops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.  (Applause.)  Look, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing.  No reason.  None.  No reason.  (Applause.)  So, folks, there’s no reason why American — American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries.  I mean, there is no reason.  We have this capacity.  (Applause.)  We have the brightest, best-trained people in the world.  The American Jobs Plan is going to create millions of good-paying jobs — jobs Americans can raise a family on — as my dad would then say, “with a little breathing room.”  And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: Buy American.  (Applause.)  Buy American.  And I might note, parenthetically — (applause) — that does not — that does not violate any trade agreement.  It’s been the law since the ’30s: Buy American.   American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America to create American jobs.  That’s the way it’s supposed to be and it will be in this administration.  (Applause.)  And I made it clear to all my Cabinet people.  Their ability to give exemptions has been exstrenuously [sic] limited.  It will be American products.  Now I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you.  So many of you — so many of the folks I grew up with feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that’s so rapidly changing.  It’s frightening.   I want to speak directly to you.  Because if you think about it, that’s what people are most worried about: “Can I fit in?”  Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come.  It is a — it is an eight-year program.  These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced.  Nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree; 75 percent don’t require an associate’s degree.  The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America.  That’s what it is.  (Applause.)  And it recognizes something I’ve always said in this chamber and the other.  Good guys and women on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn’t build this country.  The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class.  (Applause.)  So that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Act — the PRO Act — and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize.  (Applause.)  And, by the way, while you’re thinking about sending things to my desk — (laughs) — let’s raise the minimum wage to $15.  (Applause.)  No one — no one working 40 hours a week — no one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line.  We need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women.  And while we’re doing this, let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as well — equal pay.  It’s been much too long.  And if you’re wondering whether it’s too long, look behind me.  (Applause.)  And finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record.  We will see more technological change — and some of you know more about this than I do — we’ll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50.  That’s how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.  And we’re falling behind the competition with the rest of the world.  Decades ago, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America — 2 percent of our gross domestic product — in research and development.   Today, Mr. Secretary, that’s less than 1 percent.  China and other countries are closing in fast.  We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.  The Secretary of Defense can tell you — and those of you on — who work on national security issues know — the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA — the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency.  The people who set up before I came here — and that’s been a long time ago — to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security -– that’s their only job.  And it’s a semi-separate agency; it’s under the Defense Department.  It’s led to everything from the discovery of the Internet to GPS and so much more that has enhanced our security.  The National Institute of Health — the NIH –- I believe, should create a similar Advanced Research Projects 
Agency for Health.  (Applause.)  And that would — here’s what it would do.  It would have a singular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer.  I’ll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President — almost $9 million going to NIH.  And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I’ll never forget you standing and mentioning — saying you’d name it after my deceased son.  It meant a lot.  But so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who died of cancer.  I can think of no more worthy investment.  I know of nothing that is more bipartisan.  So, let’s end cancer as we know it.  (Applause.)  It’s within our power.  (Applause.)  It’s within our power to do it.  (Applause.)  Investments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we’re talking about, have often had bipartisan support in the past.  Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan.  And I applaud a group of Republican senators who just put forward their own proposal.  So, let’s get to work.  I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the deep discussions.  I’d like to meet with those who have ideas that are different — they think are better.  I welcome those ideas.   But the rest of the world is not waiting for us.  I just want to be clear: From my perspective, doing nothing is not an option.  (Applause.)  Look, we can’t be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.  Secretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi — traveled over 17,000 miles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him.  When he called to congratulate me, we had a two-hour discussion.  He’s deadly earnest about becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world.  He and others — autocrats — think that democracy can’t compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus.   To win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children.  That’s why I’ve introduced the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.  First is access to a good education.  When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.  It’s, I believe, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st — in the 20th century.   But the world has caught up, or catching up.  They are not waiting.  I would say, parenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, “Okay, we’re going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education,” I wonder whether we’d think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century.  I doubt it.  Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st Century.  That’s why my American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.  The great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years.  It shows that adding two years of universal high-quality preschool for every three-year-old and four-year-old, no matter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years.  It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduation.  The research shows when a young child goes to school — not daycare — they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.  When you add two years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the dynamic.  (Applause.)  We can do that.  (Applause.)   And we’ll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions.  The reason is: They don’t have the endowments, but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy — all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.  Jill was  a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady.  She has long said — (applause).  She has long — (applause).  If I’ve heard it once, I’ve heard it a thousand times: “Joe, any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us.”  She’ll be deeply involved in leading this effort.  Thank you, Jill.  Second thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare.  We guarantee — (applause).  And I’m proposing a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5.  The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime.  Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave  and medical leave — family and medical leave.  We’re one of the few industrial countries in the world — (applause).   No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones –- a parent, a spouse, or child.  And fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans.  In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family.  Up to a $3,000 per child if they’re under [over]* six years of age — I mean, excuse me — under — over six years of age, and $3,600 for children over [under]* six years of age.  With two parents, two kids, that’s $7,200 in the pockets that’s going to help to take care of your family.  And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child] poverty in half.  (Applause.)  And we can afford it.   So we did that in the rec- — in the — in the last piece of legislation we passed. But let’s extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025.  (Applause.)    The American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act.  I know that’s really popular on this side of the aisle.  (Laughter.)  But let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up.  (Applause.)    In addition to my Families Plan, I’m going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families.   The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women’s health.  And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly — how badly it’s needed.  Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care — in the Affordable Care Act.  (Applause.)  And let’s lower prescription drug costs.  (Applause.)   We know how to do this.  The last President had that as an objective.  We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America.   In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in America — nearly three times — for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay.  We have to change that, and we can.   Let’s do what we’ve always talked about for all the years I was down here in this — in this body — in Congress.  Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices.  (Applause.)  And, by the way, that won’t just — that won’t just help people on Medicare; it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone.   And the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny.  It’s within our power to do it; let’s do it now.  (Applause.)  We’ve talked about it long enough.  Democrats and Republicans, let’s get it done this year.  This is all about a simple premise: Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege in America.  (Applause.)   So, how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan?  I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits.  Let’s start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000.  It’s — but it’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share.  (Applause.)  Just their fair share.   Sometimes I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party.  I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.  A recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero federal tax last year.  Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit.  A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands.  And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas.  It’s not right.   We’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well.  (Applause.)  We’re going to reward work, not just wealth.  We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans — those making over $400,000 or more — back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he started: 39.6 percent.  That’s where it was when George W. was President.   We’re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck.   We’re only going to affect three tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that action.  Three tenths of 1 percent.   And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes.  It’s estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that are left, right, and center.   I’m not looking to punish anybody.  But I will not add a tax burden — an additional tax burden to the middle class in this country.  They’re already paying enough.  I believe what I propose is fair — (applause) — fiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed, and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.  When you hear someone say that they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or corporate America, ask them: “Whose taxes you want to raise instead?  Whose are you going to cut?”   Look, the big tax cut of 2017 — remember, it was supposed to pay for itself — that was how it was sold — and generate vast economic growth.  Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit.  It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.    Instead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development, it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs.  In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history.   According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes.  It used to be in the — below a hundred.   The pandemic has only made things worse.  Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemic — working- and middle-class Americans.  At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion — in the same exact period.  Let me say it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic.  And they’re now worth more than $4 trillion.   My fellow Americans, trickle-down — trickle-down economics has never worked and it’s time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. (Applause.)   You know, there’s a broad consensus of economists — left, right, center — and they agree what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth.  These are among the highest-value investments we can make as a nation.   I’ve often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our power.    In my conversations with world leaders — and I’ve spoken to over 38, 40 of them now — I’ve made it known — I’ve made it known that America is back.  And you know what they say?  The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say, “We see America is back but for how long?  But for how long?”  My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we’re back, but that we’re back to stay and that we aren’t going to go it alone.  (Applause.)  We’re going to do it by leading with our allies.  (Applause.)     No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time — from terrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well as experi- — what we’re experiencing now with pandemics.   There’s no wall high enough to keep any virus out.  And our own vaccine supply — as it grows to meet our needs; and we’re meeting them — will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries, just as America was the arsenal of democracy for the world — (applause) — and in consequence, influenced the world.  (Applause.)    But every American will have access before that occur- — every American will have access to be fully covered by COVID-19 — from the vaccines we have.  Look, the climate crisis is not our fight alone; it’s a global fight.  The United States accounts, as all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions.  The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent.  That’s why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Accord — because if we do everything perfectly, it’s not going to ultimately matter.  I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the major economies of the world — China, Russia, India, the European Union — and I said I’d do it in my first 100 days.  I want to be very blunt about it: I had — my attempt was to make sure that the world could see there was a consensus, that we are at an inflection point in history.  And consensus — the consensus is: If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world.  If you’ve watched any of it — and you were all busy; I’m sure you didn’t have much time — that’s what virtually every nation said, even the ones that aren’t doing their fair share.  The investments I’ve proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, that benefits the middle class.  That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China.  In my discussions — in my discussions with President Xi, I told him, “We welcome the competition.  We’re not looking for conflict.”  But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America’s interests across the board.  America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state — to state-owned operations and enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.  I also told President Xi that we’ll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific, just as we do with NATO in Europe — not to start a conflict, but to prevent one.  (Applause.)   I told him what I’ve said to many world leaders: that America will not back away from our commitments — our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms and to our alliances.  And I pointed out to him: No responsible American President could remain silent when basic human rights are being so blatantly violated.  An American President — President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for.  America is an idea — the most unique idea in history: We are created, all of us, equal.  It’s who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle and, in fact, say we’re dealing with the American idea.  With regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I made very clear to Putin that we’re not going to seek esca- — ecala- — exc- — excuse me — escalation, but their actions will have consequence 
if they turn out to be true.  And they turned out to be true, so I responded directly and proportionally to Russia’s interference in our elections and the cyberattacks on our government and our business.  They did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have.  But we can also cooperate when it’s in our mutual interest.  We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we’re working to do it on climate change.  But he understands we will respond.  On Iran and North Korea — nuclear programs that present serious threats to American security and the security of the world — we’re going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through di- — through diplomacy, as well as stern deterrence.  And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan.  (Applause.)  We have — (applause) — we have, without hyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world.  I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a warzone.   Today we have servicemembers serving in the same warzone as their parents did.  We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11.  The War in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be multi-generational undertakings of nation-building.  We went to Afghanistan to get terrorists — the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 — and we said we would follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell to do it.  If you’ve been to the upper Kunar Valley, you’ve kind of seen the gates of hell.  And we delivered justice to bin Laden.  We degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan.  And after 20 years of value — valor and sacrifice, it’s time to bring those troops home.  (Applause.)   Look, even as we do, we will maintain an over-the-horizon capacity to suppress future threats to the homeland.  And make no mistake: In 20 years, terrorists has — terrorism has metastasized.  The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan.  And those of you in the intelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, the defense committees, you know well: We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from.  Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, the Middle East, and beyond.   And we won’t ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism.  We’re not going to ignore that either.  My fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this nation.  It was nearly a year ago, before her father’s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young daughter.  She’s a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the eye.  And she looked at me and she said, “My daddy changed the world.”  Well, after the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was if — if we have the courage to act as a Congress.   We’ve all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans.  Now is our opportunity to make some real progress.  The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our communities, and they serve them honorably.  I know them.  I know they want — (applause) — I know they want to help meet this moment as well.  My fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact police reform in George Floyd’s name that passed the House already.   I know Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate.  We need to work together to find a consensus.  But let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death.  (Applause.)   The country supports this reform, and Congress should act — should act.  We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justice — real justice.  And with the plans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America and American lives in other ways; a chance to deliver real equity — good jobs, good schools, affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down two generations because you have an access to purchase a house.  Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans — Black, white, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans.  Look, I also want to thank the United States Senate for voting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.  (Applause.)  You acted decisively.  (Applause.)  And you can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we’ve seen over the past year — this past year and for too long.  I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, which I will gladly, anxiously sign.  I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans.  (Applause.)  To all transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want you to know your President has your back.  Another thing: Let’s authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law for 27 years.  (Applause.)  Twenty-seven years ago, I wrote it.  It’ll close the — the act that has to be authorized now will close the “boyfriend” loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers.  The court order said, “This is an abuser.  You can’t own a gun.”  It’s to close that loophole that existed.   You know, it’s estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America — 50 a month.  Let’s pass it and save some lives.  (Applause.)  And I need not — I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America.  The flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado.  And in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America — 250 shot dead.  I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue.  In the ’90s, we passed universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired off in seconds.  We beat the NRA.  Mass shootings and gun violence declined.  Check out the report in over 10 years.  But in the early twe- — 2000s, the law expired, and we’ve seen daily bloodshed since.  I’m not saying if the law continued, we wouldn’t see bloodshed.    More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know — the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence — I laid out several of the Department of Justice a- — actions that are being taken to — impact on this epidemic.   One of them is banning so-called “ghost guns.”  These are homemade guns built from a kit that includes directions on how to finish the firearm.  The parts have no serial numbers, so they show up at crime scenes and they can’t be traced.  The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren’t required to pass any background check.  Anyone, from a criminal or terrorist, could buy this kit and within 30 minutes have a weapon that’s lethal.  But no more.  And I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence, but it’s time for Congress to act as well.  (Applause.)  Look, I don’t want to become confrontational but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of Democrat colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of guns.  We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.  And don’t tell me it can’t be done.  We did it before, and it worked.  Talk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds in a weapon.  What do you think — deer are wearing Kevlar vests?  (Laughter.)  They’ll tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun but shouldn’t be able to buy a gun.  These kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, including many gun owners.  The country supports reform and is — and Congress should act.  This shouldn’t be a red or blue issue.  And no amendment to the Constitution is absolute.  You can’t yell “Fire!” in a crowded theater.  From the very beginning, there were certain guns, weapons, that could not be owned by Americans.  Certain people could not own those weapons ever.   We’re not changing the Constitution; we’re being reasonable.  I think this is not a Democrat or Republican issue; I think it’s an American issue.  And here’s what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to America.  Let’s end our exhausting war over immigration.  For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we’ve done nothing about it.  It’s time to fix it.  On day one of my presidency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration bill to the United States Congress.  If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for high-tech border security.  If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it so over 11 million undocumented folks — the vast majority are here overstaying visas.  Pass it.  We can actually — if you actually want to solve a problem, I’ve sent a bill to take a close look at it.   We have to — also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly to — to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador: the violence, the corruption, the gangs, and the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters.   When I was President, my President — when I was Vice President, the President asked me to focus on providing the help needed to address the root causes of migration.  And it helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave.  The plan was working, but the last administration decided it was not worth it.  I’m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this.  I have absolute confidence she’ll get the job done.  (Applause.)  Now, look, if you don’t like my plan, let’s at least pass what we all agree on.  Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for DREAMers — the young people who have only known America as their home.  (Applause.)   And permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and natural-made violence and disaster.  (Applause.)  As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables.  (Applause.)   Look, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our history.  The country supports immigration reform.  We should act.  Let’s argue over it, let’s debate it, but let’s act.  (Applause.)  And if we truly want to restore the soul of America, we need to protect the sacred right to vote.  Most people — (applause).    More people voted in the last presidential election than any time in American history, in the middle of the worst pandemic ever.  It should be celebrated.  Instead, it’s being attacked.  Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my desk right away.  (Applause.)  The country supports it.  The Congress should act now.  (Applause.)  Look, in closing, as we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol, desecrating our democracy, remain vivid in all our minds.  Lives were put at risk — many of your lives.  Lives were lost.  Extraordinary courage was summoned.  The insurrection was an existential crisis –- a test of whether our democracy could survive.  And it did.  But the struggle is far from over.  The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent, as old as our Republic — still vital today.   Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility?  Can our democracy deliver the most — to the most pressing needs of our people?   Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate, and fears that have pulled us apart?  America’s adversaries –- the autocrats of the world –- are betting we can’t.  And I promise you, they’re betting we can’t.  They believe we’re too full of anger and division and rage.  They look at the images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy.  But they are wrong.  You know it; I know it.  But we have to prove them wrong.  We have to prove democracy still works — that our government still works and we can deliver for our people.  In our first 100 days together, we have acted to restore the people’s faith in democracy to deliver.  We’re vaccinating the nation.  We’re creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs.  We’re delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives.  Opening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice — that’s the essence of America.  That’s democracy in action.  Our Constitution opens with the words — as trite as it sounds — “We the People”.  Well, it’s time to remember that “We the People” are the government — you and I.  Not some force in a distant capital.  Not some powerful force that we have no control over.  It’s us.  It’s “We the People.”  In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us, “In America, we do our part.”  We all do our part.  That’s all I’m asking: that we do our part, all of us.  If we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong.  Autocrats will not win the future.  We will.  America will.  And the future belongs to America.  As I stand here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our nation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic about America — not because I’m President, because what’s happening with the American people.  We have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain, and “We the People” did not flinch.  At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail, we came together.  We united.  With light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new resolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more perfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one nation, and one America.  Folks, as I told every world leader I’ve ever met with over the years, it’s never ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn’t.  (Applause.)  We are the United States of America.  (Applause.)  There is not a single thing — nothing — nothing beyond our capacity.  We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together.  (Applause.)  So let’s begin to get together.  (Applause.)  God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.  Thank you for your patience.  (Applause.)"	"What is the date of the State of the Union Address given by President Biden mentioned in the text? 
"		No			
2	"State of the Union Address given by President Biden on February 7, 2023  Mr. Speaker. Madam Vice President. Our First Lady and Second Gentleman.  Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military.  Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court.  And you, my fellow Americans.  I start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working together.  I also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the first Black House Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries.  Congratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch McConnell.  And congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader, this time with an even bigger majority.  And I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi.  The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.  A story that is unique among all nations.  We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.  That is what we are doing again.  Two years ago, our economy was reeling.  As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.  Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.  Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.  And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.  Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.  As we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.  You know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together.  But over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.  Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone.  But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.  Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.  Came together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people.  Came together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.  In fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.  To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress.  The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.  And that’s always been my vision for our country.  To restore the soul of the nation.  To rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class.  To unite the country.  We’ve been sent here to finish the job.  For decades, the middle class was hollowed out.  Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down.  Once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.  And along the way, something else was lost.  Pride. That sense of self-worth.  I ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.  To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.  As my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey –it’s going to be OK,” and mean it.  So, let’s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.  We’ve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.  Where is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again?  For too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs.  Now, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs.  Inflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies.  But we’re better positioned than any country on Earth.  We have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.  Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.  Food inflation is coming down.  Inflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up.  Additionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small business.  Every time somebody starts a small business, it’s an act of hope.  And the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted.  Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibility.  Semiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more. These chips were invented right here in America.  America used to make nearly 40% of the world’s chips.  But in the last few decades, we lost our edge and we’re down to producing only 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut down.  Today’s automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers couldn’t make enough cars because there weren’t enough chips.  Car prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones.  We can never let that happen again.  That’s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.  We’re making sure the supply chain for America begins in America.  We’ve already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law.  With this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country.  That’s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years.  Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres – a literal field of dreams.  That’ll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.  Jobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don’t require a college degree.  Jobs where people don’t have to leave home in search of opportunity.  And it’s just getting started.  Think about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that will come to life.  Talk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they’ll tell you what this means to their communities.  We’re seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland.  But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best infrastructure in the world.  We used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th.  Now we’re coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.  Already, we’ve funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland.  These projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and high-speed internet across America.  Urban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal.  And we’re just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law.  And to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don’t worry.  I promised to be the president for all Americans.  We’ll fund your projects. And I’ll see you at the ground-breaking.  This law will help further unite all of America.  Major projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs.  One of the nation’s most congested freight routes carrying $2 billion worth of freight every day. Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades, but we’re finally going to get it done.  I went there last month with Democrats and Republicans from both states to deliver $1.6 billion for this project.  While I was there, I met an ironworker named Sara, who is here tonight.  For 30 years, she’s been a proud member of Ironworkers Local 44, known as the “cowboys of the sky” who built the Cincinnati skyline.  Sara said she can’t wait to be ten stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. That’s pride.  That’s what we’re also building – Pride.  We’re also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers, so every child in America can drink clean water.  We’re making sure that every community has access to affordable, high-speed internet.  No parent should have to drive to a McDonald’s parking lot so their kid can do their homework online.  And when we do these projects, we’re going to Buy American.  Buy American has been the law of the land since 1933. But for too long, past administrations have found ways to get around it.  Not anymore.  Tonight, I’m also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.  American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables.  And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.  My economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible.  Maybe that’s you, watching at home.  You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.  I get it.  That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind.  Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.  For example, too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer, your child gets sick, or if something happens to you.  Will you have the money to pay your medical bills? Will you have to sell the house?  I get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we’re taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night.  You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth.  For example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.  Every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make.  But, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.  Not anymore.  We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.  But there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives.  Let’s finish the job this time.  Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it.  This law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year.  If drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the difference.  And we’re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn’t just save seniors money.  It will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare.  Why wouldn’t we want to do that?  Now, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.  Make no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it.  I’m pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in history.  A record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.  Thanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums.  But the way that law was written, that benefit expires after 2025.  Let’s finish the job, make those savings permanent, and expand coverage to those left off Medicaid.  Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis.  Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, and leading the world to a clean energy future.  I’ve visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts, storms and wildfires.  In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we are rebuilding for the long term.  New electric grids able to weather the next major storm.  Roads and water systems to withstand the next big flood.  Clean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities too often left behind.  We’re building 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers.  And helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.  Historic conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our lands.  Let’s face reality.  The climate crisis doesn’t care if your state is red or blue. It is an existential threat.  We have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I’m proud of how America is at last stepping up to the challenge.  But there’s so much more to do.  We will finish the job.  And we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.  I’m a capitalist. But just pay your fair share.  And I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is simply unfair.  The idea that in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes?  That’s simply not fair.  But now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%.  Just 15%.  That’s less than a nurse pays. Let me be clear.  Under my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes.  Nobody. Not one penny.  But there’s more to do.  Let’s finish the job. Reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for a billionaire minimum tax.  Because no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.  You may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profits.  Last year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis.  It’s outrageous.  They invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down.  Instead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.  Corporations ought to do the right thing.  That’s why I propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments instead.  They will still make a considerable profit.  Let’s finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes.  Instead of cutting the number of audits of wealthy tax payers, I signed a law that will reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats.  That’s being fiscally responsible.  In the last two years, my administration cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion – the largest deficit reduction in American history.  Under the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a 
row.  Because of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor.  Nearly 25% of the entire national debt, a debt that took 200 years to accumulate, was added by that administration alone.  How did Congress respond to all that debt?  They lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis.  They paid America’s bills to prevent economic disaster for our country.  Tonight, I’m asking this Congress to follow suit.  Let us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned.  Some of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage unless I agree to their economic plans. All of you at home should know what their plans are.  Instead of making the wealthy pay their fair share, some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years.  That means if Congress doesn’t vote to keep them, those programs will go away.  Other Republicans say if we don’t cut Social Security and Medicare, they’ll let America default on its debt for the first time in our history.  I won’t let that happen.  Social Security and Medicare are a lifeline for millions of seniors.  Americans have been paying into them with every single paycheck since they started working.  So tonight, let’s all agree to stand up for seniors. Stand up and show them we will not cut Social Security. We will not cut Medicare.  Those benefits belong to the American people. They earned them.  If anyone tries to cut Social Security, I will stop them. And if anyone tries to cut Medicare, I will stop them.  I will not allow them to be taken away.  Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.  Next month when I offer my fiscal plan, I ask my Republican friends to offer their plan.  We can sit down together and discuss both plans together.  My plan will lower the deficit by $2 trillion.  I won’t cut a single Social Security or Medicare benefit.  In fact, I will extend the Medicare Trust Fund by at least two decades.  I will not raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. And I will pay for the ideas I’ve talked about tonight by making the wealthy and big corporations begin to pay their fair share.  Look, here’s the deal. Big corporations aren’t just taking advantage of the tax code. They’re taking advantage of you, the American consumer.  Here’s my message to all of you out there: I have your back. We’re already preventing insurance companies from sending surprise medical bills, stopping 1 million surprise bills a month.  We’re protecting seniors’ lives and life savings by cracking down on nursing homes that commit fraud, endanger patient safety, or prescribe drugs they don’t need.  Millions of Americans can now save thousands of dollars because they can finally get hearing aids over-the-counter without a prescription.  Capitalism without competition is not capitalism. It is exploitation.  Last year I cracked down on foreign shipping companies that were making you pay higher prices for everyday goods coming into our country.  I signed a bipartisan bill that cut shipping costs by 90%, helping American farmers, businesses, and consumers.  Let’s finish the job.  Pass bipartisan legislation to strengthen antitrust enforcement and prevent big online platforms from giving their own products an unfair advantage.  My administration is also taking on “junk” fees, those hidden surcharges too many businesses use to make you pay more.  For example, we’re making airlines show you the full ticket price upfront and refund your money if your flight is cancelled or delayed.  We’ve reduced exorbitant bank overdraft fees, saving consumers more than $1 billion a year.  We’re cutting credit card late fees by 75%, from $30 to $8.  Junk fees may not matter to the very wealthy, but they matter to most folks in homes like the one I grew up in. They add up to hundreds of dollars a month.  They make it harder for you to pay the bills or afford that family trip.  I know how unfair it feels when a company overcharges you and gets away with it.  Not anymore.  We’ve written a bill to stop all that. It’s called the Junk Fee Prevention Act.  We’ll ban surprise “resort fees” that hotels tack on to your bill. These fees can cost you up to $90 a night at hotels that aren’t even resorts.  We’ll make cable internet and cellphone companies stop charging you up to $200 or more when you decide to switch to another provider.  We’ll cap service fees on tickets to concerts and sporting events and make companies disclose all fees upfront.  And we’ll prohibit airlines from charging up to $50 roundtrip for families just to sit together.  Baggage fees are bad enough – they can’t just treat your child like a piece of luggage.  Americans are tired of being played for suckers.  Pass the Junk Fee Prevention Act so companies stop ripping us off.  For too long, workers have been getting stiffed.  Not anymore.  We’re beginning to restore the dignity of work.  For example, 30 million workers had to sign non-compete agreements when they took a job. So a cashier at a burger place can’t cross the street to take the same job at another burger place to make a couple bucks more.  Not anymore.  We’re banning those agreements so companies have to compete for workers and pay them what they’re worth.  I’m so sick and tired of companies breaking the law by preventing workers from organizing.  Pass the PRO Act because workers have a right to form a union. And let’s guarantee all workers a living wage.  Let’s also make sure working parents can afford to raise a family with sick days, paid family and medical leave, and affordable child care that will enable millions more people to go to work.  Let’s also restore the full Child Tax Credit, which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.  And by the way, when we do all of these things, we increase productivity. We increase economic growth.  Let’s also finish the job and get more families access to affordable and quality housing.  Let’s get seniors who want to stay in their homes the care they need to do so. And give a little more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones.  Pass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing God’s work.  These plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do them.  Restoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class.  When we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.  But the world has caught up.  Jill, who teaches full-time, has an expression: “Any nation that out-educates us will out-compete us.”  Folks, you all know 12 years is not enough to win the economic competition for the 21st Century.  If you want America to have the best-educated workforce, let’s finish the job by providing access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds.  Studies show that children who go to pre-school are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their background.  Let’s give public school teachers a raise.  And we’re making progress by reducing student debt and increasing Pell Grants for working- and middle-class families.  Let’s finish the job, connect students to career opportunities starting in high school and provide two years of community college, some of the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree.  Let’s offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not.  And folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis when schools were closed, let’s also recognize how far we’ve come in the fight against the pandemic itself.  While the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people, we have broken COVID’s grip on us.  COVID deaths are down nearly 90%.  We’ve saved millions of lives and opened our country back up.  And soon we’ll end the public health emergency.  But we will remember the toll and pain that will never go away for so many. More than 1 million Americans have lost their lives to COVID.  Families grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table.  We remember them, and we remain vigilant.  We still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.  So Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe.  And as we emerge from this crisis stronger, I’m also doubling down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat during the pandemic.  Before I came to office many inspector generals who protect taxpayer dollars were sidelined. Fraud was rampant.  Last year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then, we’ve recovered billions of taxpayer dollars.  Now, let’s triple our anti-fraud strike forces going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars from the American people.  For every dollar we put into fighting fraud, taxpayers get back at least ten times as much.  COVID left other scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.  We have an obligation to make sure all our people are safe.  Public safety depends on public trust. But too often that trust is violated.  Joining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols, who had to bury him just last week. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a child.  But imagine what it’s like to lose a child at the hands of the law.  Imagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car.  I’ve never had to have the talk with my children – Beau, Hunter, and Ashley – that so many Black and Brown families have had with their children.  If a police officer pulls you over, turn on your interior lights. Don’t reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel.  Imagine having to worry like that every day in America.  Here’s what Tyre’s mom shared with me when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out.  With faith in God, she said her son “was a beautiful soul and something good will come from this.”  Imagine how much courage and character that takes.  It’s up to us. It’s up to all of us.  We all want the same thing.  Neighborhoods free of violence.  Law enforcement who earn the community’s trust.  Our children to come home safely.  Equal protection under the law; that’s the covenant we have with each other in America.  And we know police officers put their lives on the line every day, and we ask them to do too much.  To be counselors, social workers, psychologists; responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and more.  We ask too much of them.  I know most cops are good, decent people. They risk their lives every time they put on that shield.  But what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often.  We have to do better.  Give law enforcement the training they need, hold them to higher standards, and help them succeed in keeping everyone safe.  We also need more first responders and other professionals to address growing mental health and substance abuse challenges.  More resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime; more community intervention programs; more investments in housing, education, and job training.  All this can help prevent violence in the first place.  And when police officers or departments violate the public’s trust, we must hold them accountable.  With the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act.  Let’s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyre’s mother come true, something good must come from this.  All of us in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment.  We can’t turn away.  Let’s do what we know in our hearts we need to do.  Let’s come together and finish the job on police reform.  Do something.  That was the same plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde: Do something on gun violence.  Thank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.  That includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support, like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21-year-olds and red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others.  But we know our work is not done.  Joining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero.  Brandon put off his college dreams to stay by his mom’s side as she was dying from cancer. He now works at a dance studio started by his grandparents.  Two weeks ago, during Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio’s front door close and saw a man pointing a gun at him.  He thought he was going to die, but then he thought about the people inside.  In that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studio.  He saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well.  Ban assault weapons once and for all.  We did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994.  In the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled.  Let’s finish the job and ban assault weapons again.  And let’s also come together on immigration and make it a bipartisan issue like it was before.  We now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.  Since we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%.  But America’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts.  If you won’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.  Here in the people’s House, it’s our duty to protect all the people’s rights and freedoms.  Congress must restore the right the Supreme Court took away last year and codify Roe v. Wade to protect every woman’s constitutional right to choose.  The Vice President and I are doing everything we can to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy. But already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans.  Make no mistake; if Congress passes a national abortion ban, I will veto it.  Let’s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity.  Our strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example. Let’s remember the world is watching.  I spoke from this chamber one year ago, just days after Vladimir Putin unleashed his brutal war against Ukraine.  A murderous assault, evoking images of the death and destruction Europe suffered in World War II.  Putin’s invasion has been a test for the ages. A test for America. A test for the world.  Would we stand for the most basic of principles?  Would we stand for sovereignty?  Would we stand for the right of people to live free from tyranny?  Would we stand for the defense of democracy?  For such a defense matters to us because it keeps the peace and prevents open season for would-be aggressors to threaten our security and prosperity. One year later, we know the answer.  Yes, we would.  And yes, we did.  Together, we did what America always does at our best.  We led.  We united NATO and built a global coalition.  We stood against Putin’s aggression.  We stood with the Ukrainian people.  Tonight, we are once again joined by Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States. She represents not just her nation, but the courage of her people.  Ambassador, America is united in our support for your country. We will stand with you as long as it takes.  Our nation is working for more freedom, 
more dignity, and more peace, not just in Europe, but everywhere.  Before I came to office, the story was about how the People’s Republic of China was increasing its power and America was falling in the world.  Not anymore.  I’ve made clear with President Xi that we seek competition, not conflict.  I will make no apologies that we are investing to make America strong. Investing in American innovation, in industries that will define the future, and that China’s government is intent on dominating.  Investing in our alliances and working with our allies to protect our advanced technologies so they’re not used against us.  Modernizing our military to safeguard stability and deter aggression.  Today, we’re in the strongest position in decades to compete with China or anyone else in the world.  I am committed to work with China where it can advance American interests and benefit the world.  But make no mistake: as we made clear last week, if China’s threatens our sovereignty, we will act to protect our country. And we did.  And let’s be clear: winning the competition with China should unite all of us. We face serious challenges across the world.  But in the past two years, democracies have become stronger, not weaker.  Autocracies have grown weaker, not stronger.  America is rallying the world again to meet those challenges, from climate and global health, to food insecurity, to terrorism and territorial aggression.  Allies are stepping up, spending more and doing more.  And bridges are forming between partners in the Pacific and those in the Atlantic. And those who bet against America are learning just how wrong they are.  It’s never a good bet to bet against America.  When I came to office, most everyone assumed bipartisanship was impossible. But I never believed it.  That’s why a year ago, I offered a Unity Agenda for the nation.  We’ve made real progress.  Together, we passed a law making it easier for doctors to prescribe effective treatments for opioid addiction.  Passed a gun safety law making historic investments in mental health.  Launched ARPA-H to drive breakthroughs in the fight against cancer, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and so much more.  We passed the Heath Robinson PACT Act, named for the late Iraq war veteran whose story about exposure to toxic burn pits I shared here last year.  But there is so much more to do. And we can do it together.  Joining us tonight is a father named Doug from Newton, New Hampshire.  He wrote Jill and me a letter about his daughter Courtney. Contagious laugh. Her sister’s best friend.  He shared a story all too familiar to millions of Americans.  Courtney discovered pills in high school. It spiraled into addiction and eventually her death from a fentanyl overdose.  She was 20 years old.  Describing the last eight years without her, Doug said, “There is no worse pain.”  Yet their family has turned pain into purpose, working to end stigma and change laws.  He told us he wants to “start the journey towards America’s recovery.”  Doug, we’re with you.  Fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.  Let’s launch a major surge to stop fentanyl production, sale, and trafficking, with more drug detection machines to inspect cargo and stop pills and powder at the border.  Working with couriers like Fed Ex to inspect more packages for drugs. Strong penalties to crack down on fentanyl trafficking.  Second, let’s do more on mental health, especially for our children. When millions of young people are struggling with bullying, violence, trauma, we owe them greater access to mental health care at school.  We must finally hold social media companies accountable for the experiment they are running on our children for profit.  And it’s time to pass bipartisan legislation to stop Big Tech from collecting personal data on kids and teenagers online, ban targeted advertising to children, and impose stricter limits on the personal data these companies collect on all of us.  Third, let’s do more to keep our nation’s one truly sacred obligation: to equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home.  Job training and job placement for veterans and their spouses as they return to civilian life.  Helping veterans afford their rent because no one should be homeless in this country, especially not those who served it.  And we cannot go on losing 17 veterans a day to the silent scourge of suicide.  The VA is doing everything it can, including expanding mental health screenings and a proven program that recruits veterans to help other veterans understand what they’re going through and get the help they need.  And fourth, last year Jill and I re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot that President Obama asked me to lead in our Administration.  Our goal is to cut the cancer death rate by at least 50% over the next 25 years. Turn more cancers from death sentences into treatable diseases. And provide more support for patients and families.  It’s personal for so many of us.  Joining us are Maurice and Kandice, an Irishman and a daughter of immigrants from Panama.  They met and fell in love in New York City and got married in the same chapel as Jill and I did.  Kindred spirits.  He wrote us a letter about their little daughter Ava.  She was just a year old when she was diagnosed with a rare kidney cancer.  26 blood transfusions. 11 rounds of radiation. 8 rounds of chemo. 1 kidney removed.  A 5% survival rate.  He wrote how in the darkest moments he thought, “if she goes, I can’t stay.”  Jill and I understand, like so many of you.  They read how Jill described our family’s cancer journey and how we tried to steal moments of joy where you can.  For them, that glimmer of joy was a half-smile from their baby girl. It meant everything.  They never gave up hope.  Ava never gave up hope. She turns four next month.  They just found out that Ava beat the odds and is on her way to being cancer free, and she’s watching from the White House tonight.  For the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big things.  Twenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It’s been a huge success.  I believe we can do the same with cancer.  Let’s end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.  There’s one reason why we’re able to do all of these things: our democracy itself.  It’s the most fundamental thing of all.  With democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is.  For the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk.  Put to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th.  And then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of Representatives. Using the very same language that insurrectionists who stalked these halls chanted on January 6th.  Here tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get.  My friend, Paul Pelosi.  But such a heinous act never should have happened.  We must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. In America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right. We honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy.  And we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.  Democracy must not be a partisan issue. It must be an American issue.  Every generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called on to protect our democracy, to defend it, to stand up for it.  And this is our moment.  My fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to come.  We are not bystanders to history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power, of We the People. We are facing the test of our time and the time for choosing is at hand.  We must be the nation we have always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful. Forward-looking.  A nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos.  We must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea.  That all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world. A nation in a new age of possibilities.  So I have come here to fulfil my constitutional duty to report on the state of the union. And here is my report.  Because the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong.  As I stand here tonight, I have never been more optimistic about the future of America. We just have to remember who we are.  We are the United States of America and there is nothing, nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.  May God bless you all. May God protect our troops."
