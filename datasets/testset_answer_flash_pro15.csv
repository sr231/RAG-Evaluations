","[' workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite.\n\nIt’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do.\n\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nLet’s get it done once and for all.\n\nAdvancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women.\n\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before.\n\nIf we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America.\n\nAnd for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong.\n\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.\n\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.\n\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things.\n\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.\n\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic.\n\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.\n\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers.\n\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery.\n\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.\n\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.\n\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.\n\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.\n\nIt’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.\n\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care.\n\nThird, support our veterans.\n\nVeterans are the best of us.\n\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home.\n\nMy administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.\n\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.\n\nOne was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more.\n\nWhen they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same.\n\nHeadaches. Numbness. Dizziness.\n\nA cancer that would put them in a flag-draped coffin.\n\nI know.\n\nOne of those soldiers was my son Major Beau Biden.\n\nWe don’t know for sure if a burn pit was the cause of his brain cancer, or the diseases of so many of our troops.\n\nBut I’m committed to finding out everything we can.\n\nCommitted to military families like Danielle Robinson from Ohio.\n\nThe widow of Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson.\n\nHe was born a soldier. Army National Guard. Combat medic in Kosovo and Iraq.\n\nStationed near Baghdad, just yards from burn pits the size of football fields.\n\nHeath’s widow Danielle is here with us tonight.

"In the speech from President Biden, why has ""trickle-down economics"" not worked, and what economic approach does he advocate for instead?","[' more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck. We’re only going to affect three tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that action. Three tenths of 1 percent.\n\nAnd the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. It’s estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that are left, right, and center.\n\nI’m not looking to punish anybody. But I will not add a tax burden — an additional tax burden to the middle class in this country. They’re already paying enough. I believe what I propose is fair — (applause) — fiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed, and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.\n\nWhen you hear someone say that they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or corporate America, ask them: “Whose taxes you want to raise instead? Whose are you going to cut?”\n\nLook, the big tax cut of 2017 — remember, it was supposed to pay for itself — that was how it was sold — and generate vast economic growth. Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.\n\nInstead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development, it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history.\n\nAccording to one study, CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes. It used to be in the — below a hundred.\n\nThe pandemic has only made things worse. Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemic — working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion — in the same exact period. Let me say it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic. And they’re now worth more than $4 trillion.\n\nMy fellow Americans, trickle-down — trickle-down economics has never worked and it’s time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. (Applause.)\n\nYou know, there’s a broad consensus of economists — left, right, center — and they agree what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest-value investments we can make as a nation.\n\nI’ve often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our power.\n\nIn my conversations with world leaders — and I’ve spoken to over 38, 40 of them now — I’ve made it known — I’ve made it known that America is back. And you know what they say? The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say, “We see America is back but for how long? But for how long?”\n\nMy fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we’re back, but that we’re back to stay and that we aren’t going to go it alone. (Applause.) We’re going to do it by leading with our allies. (Applause.)\n\nNo one nation can deal with all the crises of our time — from terrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well as experi- — what we’re experiencing now with pandemics.\n\nThere’s no wall high enough to keep any virus out. And our own vaccine supply — as it grows to meet our needs; and we’re meeting them — will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries, just as America was the arsenal of democracy for the world — (applause) — and in consequence, influenced the world. (Applause.)\n\nBut every American will have access before that occur- — every American will have access to be fully covered by COVID-19 — from the vaccines we have.\n\nLook, the climate crisis is not our fight alone; it’s a global fight. The United States accounts, as all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent. That’s why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Accord — because if we do everything perfectly, it’s not going to ultimately matter.\n\nI kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the major economies of the world — China, Russia, India, the European Union —']","President Biden states that ""trickle-down economics"" has never worked because it has not resulted in economic growth from the bottom and middle out.

And together, we succeeded!\n\nInstead of an auto factory shutting down an auto factory is re-opening and a new state-of-the art battery factory is being built to power those cars.\n\nInstead of a town being left behind it’s a community moving forward again!\n\nBecause instead of watching auto jobs of the future go overseas 4,000 union workers with higher wages will be building that future, in Belvidere, here in America!\n\nHere tonight is UAW President, Shawn Fain, a great friend, and a great labor leader.\n\nAnd Dawn Simms, a third generation UAW worker  in Belvidere.\n\nShawn, I was proud to be the first President in American history to walk a picket line.\n\nAnd today Dawn has a job in her hometown providing stability for her family and pride and dignity.\n\nShowing once again, Wall Street didn’t build this country!\n\nThe middle class built this country!

"What measures does the speaker propose to lower prescription drug costs in America? 
","['- a parent, a spouse, or child.\n\nAnd fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans. In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 per child if they’re under [over]* six years of age — I mean, excuse me — under — over six years of age, and $3,600 for children over [under]* six years of age.\n\nWith two parents, two kids, that’s $7,200 in the pockets that’s going to help to take care of your family. And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child] poverty in half. (Applause.) And we can afford it.\n\nSo we did that in the rec- — in the — in the last piece of legislation we passed. But let’s extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. (Applause.)\n\nThe American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I know that’s really popular on this side of the aisle. (Laughter.) But let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up. (Applause.)\n\nIn addition to my Families Plan, I’m going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women’s health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly — how badly it’s needed. Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care — in the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) And let’s lower prescription drug costs. (Applause.)\n\nWe know how to do this. The last President had that as an objective. We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America.\n\nIn fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in America — nearly three times — for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay. We have to change that, and we can.\n\nLet’s do what we’ve always talked about for all the years I was down here in this — in this body — in Congress. Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices. (Applause.)\n\nAnd, by the way, that won’t just — that won’t just help people on Medicare; it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone.\n\nAnd the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny. It’s within our power to do it; let’s do it now. (Applause.)\n\nWe’ve talked about it long enough. Democrats and Republicans, let’s get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege in America. (Applause.)\n\nSo, how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan? I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits. Let’s start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000. It’s — but it’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share. (Applause.) Just their fair share.\n\nSometimes I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party. I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.\n\nA recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero federal tax last year. Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit. A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. It’s not right.\n\nWe’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well. (Applause.)\n\nWe’re going to reward work, not just wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans — those making over $400,000 or more — back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he started: 39.6 percent.

We’re delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives.\n\nOpening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice — that’s the essence of America. That’s democracy in action.\n\nOur Constitution opens with the words — as trite as it sounds — “We the People”. Well, it’s time to remember that “We the People” are the government — you and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force that we have no control over. It’s us. It’s “We the People.”\n\nIn another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us, “In America, we do our part.”  We all do our part. That’s all I’m asking: that we do our part, all of us.\n\nIf we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. Autocrats will not win the future. We will. America will. And the future belongs to America.\n\nAs I stand here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our nation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic about America — not because I’m President, because what’s happening with the American people.\n\nWe have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain, and “We the People” did not flinch.\n\nAt the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail, we came together. We united.\n\nWith light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new resolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more perfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one nation, and one America.\n\nFolks, as I told every world leader I’ve ever met with over the years, it’s never ever, ever been a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn’t.

And give a little more breathing room to millions of family caregivers looking after their loved ones.\n\nPass my plan so we get seniors and people with disabilities the home care services they need and support the workers who are doing God’s work.\n\nThese plans are fully paid for and we can afford to do them.\n\nRestoring the dignity of work also means making education an affordable ticket to the middle class.\n\nWhen we made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.\n\nBut the world has caught up.\n\nJill, who teaches full-time, has an expression: “Any nation that out-educates us will out-compete us.”\n\nFolks, you all know 12 years is not enough to win the economic competition for the 21st Century.\n\nIf you want America to have the best-educated workforce, let’s finish the job by providing access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds.\n\nStudies show that children who go to pre-school are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree, no matter their background.\n\nLet’s give public school teachers a raise.\n\nAnd we’re making progress by reducing student debt and increasing Pell Grants for working- and middle-class families.\n\nLet’s finish the job, connect students to career opportunities starting in high school and provide two years of community college, some of the best career training in America, in addition to being a pathway to a four-year degree.\n\nLet’s offer every American the path to a good career whether they go to college or not.\n\nAnd folks, in the midst of the COVID crisis when schools were closed, let’s also recognize how far we’ve come in the fight against the pandemic itself.\n\nWhile the virus is not gone, thanks to the resilience of the American people, we have broken COVID’s grip on us.\n\nCOVID deaths are down nearly 90%.\n\nWe’ve saved millions of lives and opened our country back up.\n\nAnd soon we’ll end the public health emergency.\n\nBut we will remember the toll and pain that will never go away for so many. More than 1 million Americans have lost their lives to COVID.\n\nFamilies grieving. Children orphaned. Empty chairs at the dining room table.\n\nWe remember them, and we remain vigilant.\n\nWe still need to monitor dozens of variants and support new vaccines and treatments.\n\nSo Congress needs to fund these efforts and keep America safe.\n\nAnd as we emerge from this crisis stronger, I’m also doubling down on prosecuting criminals who stole relief money meant to keep workers and small businesses afloat during the pandemic.\n\nBefore I came to office many inspector generals who protect taxpayer dollars were sidelined. Fraud was rampant.\n\nLast year, I told you the watchdogs are back. Since then, we’ve recovered billions of taxpayer dollars.\n\nNow, let’s triple our anti-fraud strike forces going after these criminals, double the statute of limitations on these crimes, and crack down on identity fraud by criminal syndicates stealing billions of dollars from the American people.\n\nFor every dollar we put into fighting fraud, taxpayers get back at least ten times as much.\n\nCOVID left other scars, like the spike in violent crime in 2020, the first year of the pandemic.\n\nWe have an obligation to make sure all our people are safe.\n\nPublic safety depends on public', ' trust. But too often that trust is violated.\n\nJoining us tonight are the parents of Tyre Nichols, who had to bury him just last week. There are no words to describe the heartbreak and grief of losing a child.\n\nBut imagine what it’s like to lose a child at the hands of the law.\n\nImagine having to worry whether your son or daughter will come home from walking down the street or playing in the park or just driving their car.\n\nI’ve never had to have the talk with my children – Beau, Hunter, and Ashley – that so many Black and Brown families have had with their children.\n\nIf a police officer pulls you over, turn on your interior lights. Don’t reach for your license. Keep your hands on the steering wheel.\n\nImagine having to worry like that every day in America.\n\nHere’s what Tyre’s mom shared with me when I asked her how she finds the courage to carry on and speak out.\n\nWith faith in God, she said her son “was a beautiful soul and something good will come from this.”\n\nImagine how much courage and character that takes.\n\nIt’s up to us. It’s up to all of us.\n\nWe all want the same thing.\n\nNeighborhoods free of violence.\n\nLaw enforcement who earn the community’s trust.\n\nOur children to come home safely.\n\nEqual protection under the law; that’s the covenant we have with each other in America.\n\nAnd we know police officers put their lives on the line every day, and we ask them to do too much.\n\nTo be counselors, social workers, psychologists; responding to drug overdoses, mental health crises, and more.\n\nWe ask too much of them.\n\nI know most cops are good, decent people. They risk their lives every time they put on that shield.\n\nBut what happened to Tyre in Memphis happens too often.\n\nWe have to do better.\n\nGive law enforcement the training they need, hold them to higher standards, and help them succeed in keeping everyone safe.\n\nWe also need more first responders and other professionals to address growing mental health and substance abuse challenges.\n\nMore resources to reduce violent crime and gun crime; more community intervention programs; more investments in housing, education, and job training.\n\nAll this can help prevent violence in the first place.\n\nAnd when police officers or departments violate the public’s trust, we must hold them accountable.\n\nWith the support of families of victims, civil rights groups, and law enforcement, I signed an executive order for all federal officers banning chokeholds, restricting no-knock warrants, and other key elements of the George Floyd Act.\n\nLet’s commit ourselves to make the words of Tyre’s mother come true, something good must come from this.\n\nAll of us in this chamber, we need to rise to this moment.\n\nWe can’t turn away.\n\nLet’s do what we know in our hearts we need to do.\n\nLet’s come together and finish the job on police reform.\n\nDo something.\n\nThat was the same plea of parents who lost their children in Uvalde: Do something on gun violence.\n\nThank God we did, passing the most sweeping gun safety law in three decades.\n\nThat includes things that the majority of responsible gun owners support, like enhanced background checks for 18 to 21-year-olds and red flag laws keeping guns out of the hands of people who are a danger to themselves and others.\n\nBut we know our work is not done.\n\nJoining us tonight is Brandon Tsay, a 26-year-old hero.\n\nBrandon put off his college dreams to stay by his mom’s side as she was dying from cancer. He now works at a dance studio started by his grandparents.\n\nTwo weeks ago, during Lunar New Year celebrations, he heard the studio’s front door close and saw a man pointing a gun at him.\n\nHe thought he was going to die, but then he thought about the people inside.\n\nIn that instant, he found the courage to act and wrestled the semi-automatic pistol away from a gunman who had already killed 11 people at another dance studio.\n\nHe saved lives. It’s time we do the same as well.\n\nBan assault weapons once and for all.\n\nWe did it before. I led the fight to ban them in 1994.\n\nIn the 10 years the ban was law, mass shootings went down. After Republicans let it expire, mass shootings tripled.\n\nLet’s finish the job and ban assault weapons again.\n\nAnd let�']","President Biden mentioned the need to ban assault weapons after discussing the recent gun safety law in his State of the Union address.

In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 per child if they’re under [over]* six years of age — I mean, excuse me — under — over six years of age, and $3,600 for children over [under]* six years of age.\n\nWith two parents, two kids, that’s $7,200 in the pockets that’s going to help to take care of your family. And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child] poverty in half. (Applause.) And we can afford it.\n\nSo we did that in the rec- — in the — in the last piece of legislation we passed. But let’s extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. (Applause.)\n\nThe American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I know that’s really popular on this side of the aisle. (Laughter.) But let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up. (Applause.)\n\nIn addition to my Families Plan, I’m going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women’s health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly — how badly it’s needed. Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care — in the Affordable Care Act. (Applause.) And let’s lower prescription drug costs. (Applause.)\n\nWe know how to do this. The last President had that as an objective. We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America.\n\nIn fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in America — nearly three times — for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay. We have to change that, and we can.\n\nLet’s do what we’ve always talked about for all the years I was down here in this — in this body — in Congress. Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices. (Applause.)\n\nAnd, by the way, that won’t just — that won’t just help people on Medicare; it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone.\n\nAnd the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny. It’s within our power to do it; let’s do it now. (Applause.)\n\nWe’ve talked about it long enough. Democrats and Republicans, let’s get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege in America. (Applause.)\n\nSo, how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan? I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits. Let’s start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000. It’s — but it’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share. (Applause.) Just their fair share.\n\nSometimes I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party. I think you should be able to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.\n\nA recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero federal tax last year. Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit. A lot of companies also evade taxes through tax havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. It’s not right.\n\nWe’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from as well. (Applause.)\n\nWe’re going to reward work, not just wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans — those making over $400,000 or more — back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he started: 39.6 percent. That’s where it was when George W. was President.\n\nWe’re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make', ' more than a million dollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a paycheck. We’re only going to affect three tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by that action. Three tenths of 1 percent.\n\nAnd the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. It’s estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that are left, right, and center.\n\nI’m not looking to punish anybody. But I will not add a tax burden — an additional tax burden to the middle class in this country. They’re already paying enough. I believe what I propose is fair — (applause) — fiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed, and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.\n\nWhen you hear someone say that they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or corporate America, ask them: “Whose taxes you want to raise instead? Whose are you going to cut?”\n\nLook, the big tax cut of 2017 — remember, it was supposed to pay for itself — that was how it was sold — and generate vast economic growth. Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.\n\nInstead of using the tax saving to raise wages and invest in research and development, it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history.\n\nAccording to one study, CEOs make 320 times what the average worker in their corporation makes. It used to be in the — below a hundred.\n\nThe pandemic has only made things worse. Twenty million Americans lost their job in the pandemic — working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion — in the same exact period. Let me say it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during this pandemic. And they’re now worth more than $4 trillion.\n\nMy fellow Americans, trickle-down — trickle-down economics has never worked and it’s time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. (Applause.)\n\nYou know, there’s a broad consensus of economists — left, right, center — and they agree what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest-value investments we can make as a nation.\n\nI’ve often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our power.\n\nIn my conversations with world leaders — and I’ve spoken to over 38, 40 of them now — I’ve made it known — I’ve made it known that America is back. And you know what they say? The comment that I hear most of all from them is they say, “We see America is back but for how long? But for how long?”\n\nMy fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we’re back, but that we’re back to stay and that we aren’t going to go it alone. (Applause.) We’re going to do it by leading with our allies. (Applause.)\n\nNo one nation can deal with all the crises of our time — from terrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well as experi- — what we’re experiencing now with pandemics.\n\nThere’s no wall high enough to keep any virus out. And our own vaccine supply — as it grows to meet our needs; and we’re meeting them — will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries, just as America was the arsenal of democracy for the world — (applause) — and in consequence, influenced the world. (Applause.)\n\nBut every American will have access before that occur- — every American will have access to be fully covered by COVID-19 — from the vaccines we have.\n\nLook, the climate crisis is not our fight alone; it’s a global fight. The United States accounts, as all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85 percent.

Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before.\n\nIf we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America.\n\nAnd for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong.\n\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.\n\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice.\n\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago.

Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.\n\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers.\n\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery.\n\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.\n\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor.\n\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media.\n\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.\n\nIt’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.\n\nAnd let’s get all Americans the mental health services they need. More people they can turn to for help, and full parity between physical and mental health care.\n\nThird, support our veterans.\n\nVeterans are the best of us.\n\nI’ve always believed that we have a sacred obligation to equip all those we send to war and care for them and their families when they come home.\n\nMy administration is providing assistance with job training and housing, and now helping lower-income veterans get VA care debt-free.\n\nOur troops in Iraq and Afghanistan faced many dangers.\n\nOne was stationed at bases and breathing in toxic smoke from “burn pits” that incinerated wastes of war—medical and hazard material, jet fuel, and more.\n\nWhen they came home, many of the world’s fittest and best trained warriors were never the same.\n\nHeadaches. Numbness.

An American President — President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for. America is an idea — the most unique idea in history: We are created, all of us, equal.

They did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have.\n\nBut we can also cooperate when it’s in our mutual interest. We did it when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we’re working to do it on climate change. But he understands we will respond.\n\nOn Iran and North Korea — nuclear programs that present serious threats to American security and the security of the world — we’re going to be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through di- — through diplomacy, as well as stern deterrence.\n\nAnd American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan.

We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11.\n\nThe War in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be multi-generational undertakings of nation-building. We went to Afghanistan to get terrorists — the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11 — and we said we would follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell to do it. If you’ve been to the upper Kunar Valley, you’ve kind of seen the gates of hell. And we delivered justice to bin Laden. We degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. And after 20 years of value — valor and sacrifice, it’s time to bring those troops home.
