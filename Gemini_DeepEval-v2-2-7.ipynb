Roosevelt urged Congress to establish the United States Forest Service (1905)', ' to manage government forest lands', ' and he appointed Gifford Pinchot to head the service. Roosevelt set aside more land for national parks and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined', ' 194 million acres (785', '000 kmÂ²). In all', ' by 1909', ' the Roosevelt administration had created an unprecedented 42 million acres (170', '000 kmÂ²) of national forests', ' 53 national wildlife refuges and 18 areas of \"special interest\"', ' including the Grand Canyon. The Theodore Roosevelt National Park in the Badlands commemorates his conservationist philosophy. Roosevelt and Muir In 1903', ' Roosevelt toured the Yosemite Valley with John Muir', ' founder of the Sierra Club', ' but Roosevelt believed in the more efficient use of natural resources by corporations like lumber companies unlike Muir. In 1907', ' with Congress about to block him', ' Roosevelt hurried to designate 16 million acres (65', '000 kmÂ²) of new national forests.  In May 1908', ' he sponsored the Conference of Governors held in the White House', ' with a focus on the most efficient planning', ' analysis and use of water', ' forests and other natural resources.  Roosevelt explained', '  \"There is an intimate relation between our streams and the development and conservation of all the other great permanent sources of wealth.\" During his presidency', ' Roosevelt promoted the nascent conservation movement in essays for Outdoor Life magazine. To Roosevelt', ' conservation meant more and better usage and less waste', ' and a long-term perspective. In 2006', \" a group of American high school students developed a 10 minute video on Roosevelt\\\\'s conservation legacy with the help of Roosevelt scholar Edward Renehan and Roosevelt descendant\", \" Tweed Roosevelt. See   Commented out because it\\\\'s a YouTube link used as a ref\", \" it\\\\'s original research\", \" and really it\\\\'s not a reference. But maybe someone else will think differently. -->']\"]\n",

They claimed Ford\\\\\\'s pardon was quid pro quo in exchange for Nixon\\\\\\'s resignation that elevated Ford to the Presidency. Nixon\\\\\\'s Chief of Staff', ' Alexander Haig', ' did in fact offer a deal to Ford. Bob Woodward', ' in his book Shadow', \" recounts that Haig entered Ford\\\\'s office on August 1\", ' 1974 while Ford was still Vice President and Nixon had yet to resign. Haig told Ford that there were three pardon options: (1) Nixon could pardon himself and resign', ' (2) Nixon could pardon his aides involved in Watergate and then resign', ' or (3) Nixon could agree to leave in return for an agreement that the new president would pardon him. After listing these options', ' Haig handed Ford various papers; one of these papers included a discussion of the president\\\\\\'s legal authority to pardon and another sheet was a draft pardon form that only needed Ford\\\\\\'s signature and Nixon\\\\\\'s name to make it legal. Woodward summarizes the setting between Haig and Ford as follows: \"Even if Haig offered no direct words on his views', ' the message was almost certainly sent. An emotional man', ' Haig was incapable of concealing his feelings; those who worked closely with him rarely found him ambiguous.\"\\'', \" 'Despite the situation\", ' Ford never accepted the offer from Haig and later decided to pardon Nixon on his own terms. Regardless', ' historians believe the controversy was one of the major reasons Ford lost the election in 1976', ' an observation with which Ford concurred.    In an editorial at the time', ' The New York Times stated that the Nixon pardon was \"a profoundly unwise', ' divisive and unjust act\" that in a stroke had destroyed the new president\\\\\\'s \"credibility as a man of judgment', ' candor and competence.\"\\'', \" 'After Ford left the White House in 1977\", ' intimates said that the former President privately justified his pardon of Nixon by carrying in his wallet a portion of the text of Burdick v. United States', ' a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt.   In 2001', \" the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon.'\", \" 'The pardon controversy eventually subsided. Ford\\\\'s successor\", ' Jimmy Carter', ' opened his 1977 inaugural address by praising the outgoing President', ' saying \"For myself and for our Nation', ' I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land.\"\\'', ' \"Ford\\'s first press secretary and close friend Jerald Franklin terHorst resigned his post in protest after the announcement of President Nixon\\'s full pardon.  Ford also voluntarily appeared before Congress on October 17', ' 1974 to give sworn testimony the only time a sitting president has done so about the pardon.\"', \" 'As president\", ' Ford signed the Helsinki Accords', ' marking a move toward dÃ©tente in the Cold War', ' even as South Vietnam', ' a former ally', ' was invaded and conquered by North Vietnam. Ford did not intervene in Vietamese affairs', ' but did help extract friends of the U.S. Domestically', ' the economy suffered from inflation and a recession under President Ford. One of his more controversial decisions was granting a presidential pardon to President Richard Nixon for his role in the Watergate scandal. In 1976', ' Ford narrowly defeated Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination', \" but ultimately lost the presidential election to Democrat Jimmy Carter.'\", \" 'Following Ford\\\\'s appointment\", ' the Watergate investigation continued until Chief of Staff Alexander Haig contacted Ford on August 1', ' 1974', ' and told him that \"smoking gun\" evidence had been found. The evidence left little doubt that President Nixon had been a part of the Watergate cover-up. At the time', ' Ford and his wife', ' Betty', ' were living in suburban Virginia', \" waiting for their expected move into the newly designated vice president\\\\'s residence in Washington\", ' D.C. However', ' \"Al Haig [asked] to come over and see me', '\" Ford later related', ' \"to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday', ' and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation. And he said', \" \\\\'I\\\\'m just warning you that you\\\\'ve got to be prepared\", \" that things might change dramatically and you could become President.\\\\' And I said\", \" \\\\'Betty\", ' I don\\\\\\'t think we\\\\\\'re ever going to live in the vice president\\\\\\'s house.\\\\\\'\"\\'', \" 'On September 8\", ' 1974', ' Ford issued Proclamation 4311', ' which gave Nixon a full and unconditional pardon for any crimes he may have committed against the United States while President.        In a televised broadcast to the nation', ' Ford explained that he felt the pardon was in the best interests of the country and that the Nixon family\\\\\\'s situation \"is a tragedy in which we all have played a part.  It could go on and on and on', ' or someone must write the end to it. I have concluded that only I can do that', ' and if I can', ' I must.\"    At the same time as he announced the Nixon pardon', ' Ford introduced a conditional amnesty program for Vietnam War draft dodgers who had fled to countries such as Canada.     Unconditional amnesty', ' however', \" did not come about until the Jimmy Carter Presidency.'\", \" 'On October 10\", ' 1973', ' Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned and then pleaded no contest to criminal charges of tax evasion and money laundering', ' part of a negotiated resolution to a scheme wherein he accepted $29', '500 in bribes during his tenure as governor of Maryland. According to The New York Times', ' \"Nixon sought advice from senior Congressional leaders about a replacement.  The advice was unanimous. \\\\\\'We gave Nixon no choice but Ford', '\\\\\\' House Speaker Carl Albert recalled later\".\\'', \" 'When Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal on August 9\", ' 1974', ' Ford assumed the presidency making him the only person to assume the vice-presidency and the presidency without having been voted into either office. Immediately after taking the oath of office in the East Room of the White House', ' he spoke to the assembled audience in a speech broadcast live to the nation. Ford noted the peculiarity of his position: \"I am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots', ' and so I ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers.\"    On August 20 Ford nominated former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller to fill the vice presidency he had vacated. Rockefeller was confirmed by the House and Senate.\\']']\n",

But molecular systematics now indicate very strongly that domestic dogs and wolves are closely related', ' and the domestic dog is now normally classified as a subspecies of the wolf: Canis lupus familiaris. The main differences between wolves and domestic dogs are that wolves have', ' on average', ' 20% larger brains', ' better immune systems', ' a better sense of smell', ' and are generally larger than domestic dogs.\"', ' \"The gray wolf is a member of the genus Canis', \" which comprises between 7 and 10 species.

    "- Contextual Precision: Average: 0.776\n",
    "  - Calculated fairly similarly (if not the same) as RAGAS's contextual precision; would need to look into code further\n",
    "  - Manual review: Decent overall, but some definitely had the single answer needed higher ranked in the nodes list, yet received a low score (0.25), likely for giving extra context that was not as relevant.\n",
    "  - Compared with RAGAS in DeepEval Contextual Precision: 0.493 (not close at all)\n",
    "  - Compared with RAGAS package Contextual Precision: 0.6944 (closer to result here, but not to the above, which should be the same)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contextual Recall: Average: 0.723\n",
    "  - Calculated approximately the same way as RAGAS, according to their brief algorithm description\n",
    "  - Manual review: Good overall, not great. The scores and reasonings are definitely dependent on the LLM.. For example, for the first test case, it said that a specific fact was not mentioned in the context when it actually was in the context.\n",
    "    - Another speaks for itself: \"The score is 1.00 because you provided an input, and asked for a JSON output. That's perfect! Let's keep going.\"\n",
    "    - In another reason given for a perfect score, it gave additional context that is not found in the retrieval context; it seemed to more try to answer the prompt vs doing the evaluation of the metric.\n",
    "  - Compared with RAGAS in DeepEval Contextual Recall: 0.627\n",
    "  - Compared with RAGAS package Context Recall: 0.6455 (pretty close)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Answer Relevancy: Average: 0.989\n",
    "  - Calculated differently than RAGAS's answer relevancy\n",
    "  - Manual review: Not great overall; some responses are reasonable, but some are not relevant, giving scores based off of whether or not a JSON output was returned. Additionally, in other examples, DeepEval provided the same score for both receiving and not receiving a response:\n",
    "    - Example 1: \"Reason: The score is 1.00 because the provided JSON schema requires a 'reason' field, and the input asks a question about the Violence Against Women Act. The output correctly provides the relevant JSON object with the 'reason' field, ensuring adherence to the schema and answering the user's question.\"\n",
    "    - Example 2: \"Reason: The score is 1.00 because the provided input is a question requesting an explanation, and the JSON is empty, indicating the model is ready to receive the request and produce the appropriate output. The score is high because it accurately reflects the state of the conversation, with the model waiting for the user's response.\"\n",
    "    - Example 3: \"Reason: The score is 1.00 because the input asks for a specific reason and expects a JSON object with that reason. The provided JSON does not contain any object to address the request, therefore the score is 1.00, implying that the output does not address the input.\"\n",
    "  - Compared with RAGAS in DeepEval Answer Relevancy: 0.578 (not close at all to DeepEval, but makes sense with different algorithmic calculation)\n",
    "  - Compared with RAGAS package Answer Relevancy: 0.6770 (pretty close to above, not to DeepEval)\n",
    "\n",

    "  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: Gemini 1.5 Flash, reason: The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than the irrelevant node, which is the last node. The last node is irrelevant because it's a general statement about presidential speeches, not about economic growth. All other nodes are relevant because they either explicitly state or imply the President's plans to grow the economy, and provide examples of economic successes. For instance, the first node states that the economy created more than 1,300,000 new jobs in 100 days, which indicates growth, and the second node quotes the President saying 'trickle-down economics has never worked and it’s time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out,' which directly supports the input., error: None)\n",

    "  - actual output: The President plans to grow the economy by focusing on the bottom and middle class, rather than trickle-down economics.  His success in this area includes creating more than 1,300,000 new jobs in his first 100 days, a record 12 million new jobs in his first two years, and a 5.7% growth in the economy last year, which is the strongest growth in nearly 40 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - expected output: In his first speech, the President proposes that his American Jobs Plan will create millions of new jobs and trillions of dollars of economic growth to the economy by bringing Americans back to the workforce. He also says America should grow its economy from the bottom and middle out but does not say how to grow the economy that way. In his following speeches, he says that the American Rescue Plan has created over 6.5 million jobs in one year and 12 million jobs in two years and 15 million jobs in three years, and America s economy increased at a rate of 5.7% the first year. American companies are also investing in increasing manufacturing capabilities in America that would help reduce costs to Americans and created 800,000 manufacturing jobs in 2 years. America s GDP also increased over the three years covered in the speeches.\n",

    "- Some of the context_recall results seemed inaccurate. For example, one returned a score of 0 but in close examination, the context did contain parts of the ground truth result. For two very similar examples, scores varied from 0 to 0.5, which seemed like a dramatic variance.\n",

    "- For those examples that the metric was generated on, the RAGAS metric was within .12 of the manually calculated averages. \n",
    "- This metric (when it gives output) seems like a general approximation for a given test case of how well the RAG pipeline answered it.\n",
    "- The overall pass rate seems useful, but given that we got 7/11 results (including 1 questionable one) on such a small test set, I don't think I would use this metric.\n"
