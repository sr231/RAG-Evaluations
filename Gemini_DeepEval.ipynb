These are further categorized into three families, based on their altitude. \\n\\n**High-level clouds:**\\n* **Cirrus (Ci):** Wispy, detached clouds made of ice crystals. They often appear as delicate strands or feathers.\\n* **Cirrocumulus (Cc):** Small, white, puffy clouds arranged in rows or patches. They resemble ripples on a lake.\\n* **Cirrostratus (Cs):** Thin, sheet-like clouds that can cover the entire sky. They often produce a halo around the sun or moon.\\n\\n**Mid-level clouds:**\\n* **Altocumulus (Ac):** White or gray patches of clouds arranged in rounded masses or layers. They can resemble cotton balls.\\n* **Altostratus (As):** Gray or bluish sheet-like clouds that can cover the entire sky. They often obscure the sun or moon, but do not produce a halo.\\n* **Nimbostratus (Ns):** Dark gray clouds that produce steady rain or snow. They often cover the entire sky and can be quite thick.\\n\\n**Low-level clouds:**\\n* **Stratocumulus (Sc):** Gray or white patches of clouds arranged in rounded masses or rolls. They often appear in layers.\\n* **Stratus (St):** Gray, featureless clouds that cover the sky like a sheet. They often produce drizzle or light snow.\\n* **Cumulus (Cu):** Puffy, white clouds with flat bases and rounded tops. They often resemble cotton balls and are often associated with fair weather.\\n* **Cumulonimbus (Cb):** Towering, thunderhead clouds that can produce heavy rain, hail, lightning, and tornadoes. They are often associated with thunderstorms.\\n\\nThis is just a basic classification of clouds. There are many other variations and subtypes of clouds that can be observed in the sky.'"

(Applause.)  Twenty-seven years ago, I wrote it.  It’ll close the — the act that has to be authorized now will close the “boyfriend” loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers.  The court order said, “This is an abuser.  You can’t own a gun.”  It’s to close that loophole that existed. \\n\\nYou know, it’s estimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America — 50 a month.  Let’s pass it and save some lives.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd I need not — I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America.\\n\\nThe flag at the White House was still flying at half-mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in Georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado.\\n\\nAnd in the week in between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America — 250 shot dead.\\n\\nI know how hard it is to make progress on this issue.

Technology we have yet to invent. \\n\\nBut that’s just the beginning. \\n\\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from  \\n$20 billion to $100 billion. \\n\\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history. \\n\\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill. \\n\\nSo let’s not wait any longer.

Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. \\n\\nGM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan. \\n\\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year. \\n\\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight. \\n\\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.” \\n\\nIt’s time. \\n\\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.  \\n\\nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel. \\n\\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. \\n\\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories. \\n\\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains. \\n\\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up. \\n\\nLook at cars. \\n\\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. \\n\\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up. \\n\\nSo—we have a choice. \\n\\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.  \\n\\nI have a better plan to fight inflation. \\n\\nLower your costs, not your wages. \\n\\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America. \\n\\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America. \\n\\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America. \\n\\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America. \\n\\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America. \\n\\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” \\n\\nI call it building a better America. \\n\\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. \\n\\n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures.

In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \\n\\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day.

Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \\n\\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \\n\\nDrug companies will still do very well.

Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.\\n\\nA story that is unique among all nations.\\n\\nWe are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.\\n\\nThat is what we are doing again.\\n\\nTwo years ago, our economy was reeling.\\n\\nAs I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.\\n\\nTwo years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.\\n\\nToday, COVID no longer controls our lives.\\n\\nAnd two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.\\n\\nToday, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.\\n\\nAs we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.\\n\\nYou know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together.\\n\\nBut over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.\\n\\nYes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone.\\n\\nBut time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.\\n\\nCame together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.\\n\\nCame together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people.\\n\\nCame together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.\\n\\nIn fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.\\n\\nTo my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress.\\n\\nThe people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.\\n\\nAnd that’s always been my vision for our country.\\n\\nTo restore the soul of the nation.\\n\\nTo rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class.\\n\\nTo unite the country.\\n\\nWe’ve been sent here to finish the job.\\n\\nFor decades, the middle class was hollowed out.\\n\\nToo many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down.\\n\\nOnce-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.\\n\\nAnd along the way, something else was lost.\\n\\nPride. That sense of self-worth.\\n\\nI ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.\\n\\nTo build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.\\n\\nAs my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey –it’s going to be OK,” and mean it.\\n\\nSo, let’s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.\\n\\nWe’| White House tonight.\\n\\nFor the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big things.\\n\\nTwenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It’s been a huge success.\\n\\nI believe we can do the same with cancer.\\n\\nLet’s end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.\\n\\nThere’s one reason why we’re able to do all of these things: our democracy itself.\\n\\nIt’s the most fundamental thing of all.\\n\\nWith democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is.\\n\\nFor the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk.\\n\\nPut to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th.\\n\\nAnd then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of Representatives.

There is no place for political violence in America. In America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right. We honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy.\\n\\nAnd we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.\\n\\nDemocracy must not be a partisan issue. It must be an American issue.\\n\\nEvery generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called on to protect our democracy, to defend it, to stand up for it.\\n\\nAnd this is our moment.\\n\\nMy fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to come.\\n\\nWe are not bystanders to history.

Forward-looking.\\n\\nA nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos.\\n\\nWe must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. We are a good people, the only nation in the world built on an idea.\\n\\nThat all of us, every one of us, is created equal in the image of God. A nation that stands as a beacon to the world.

Madam Vice President. Our First Lady and Second Gentleman.\\n\\nMembers of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military.\\n\\nMr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court.\\n\\nAnd you, my fellow Americans.\\n\\nI start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.\\n\\nMr. Speaker, I look forward to working together.\\n\\nI also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the first Black House Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries.\\n\\nCongratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch McConnell.\\n\\nAnd congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader, this time with an even bigger majority.\\n\\nAnd I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi.\\n\\nThe story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.\\n\\nA story that is unique among all nations.\\n\\nWe are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.\\n\\nThat is what we are doing again.\\n\\nTwo years ago, our economy was reeling.\\n\\nAs I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.\\n\\nTwo years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.\\n\\nToday, COVID no longer controls our lives.\\n\\nAnd two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.\\n\\nToday, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.\\n\\nAs we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.\\n\\nYou know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together.\\n\\nBut over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.\\n\\nYes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone.\\n\\nBut time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.\\n\\nCame together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.\\n\\nCame together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people.\\n\\nCame together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.\\n\\nIn fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.\\n\\nTo my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress.\\n\\nThe people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.\\n\\nAnd that’s always been my vision for our country.\\n\\nTo restore the soul of the nation.\\n\\nTo rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class.\\n\\nTo unite the country.\\n\\nWe’ve been sent here to finish the job.\\n\\nFor decades, the middle class was hollowed out.\\n\\nToo many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down.\\n\\nOnce-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.\\n\\nAnd along the way, something else was lost.\\n\\nPride. That sense of self-worth.\\n\\nI ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.\\n\\nTo build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.\\n\\nAs my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey –it’s going to be OK,” and mean it.\\n\\nSo, let’s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.\\n\\nWe’| White House tonight.\\n\\nFor the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big things.\\n\\nTwenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It’s been a huge success.\\n\\nI believe we can do the same with cancer.\\n\\nLet’s end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.\\n\\nThere’s one reason why we’re able to do all of these things: our democracy itself.\\n\\nIt’s the most fundamental thing of all.\\n\\nWith democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is.\\n\\nFor the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk.\\n\\nPut to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th.\\n\\nAnd then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of Representatives. Using the very same language that insurrectionists who stalked these halls chanted on January 6th.\\n\\nHere tonight in this chamber is the man who bears the scars of that brutal attack, but is as tough and strong and as resilient as they get.\\n\\nMy friend, Paul Pelosi.\\n\\nBut such a heinous act never should have happened.\\n\\nWe must all speak out. There is no place for political violence in America. In America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right. We honor the results of our elections, not subvert the will of the people. We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy.\\n\\nAnd we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.\\n\\nDemocracy must not be a partisan issue.

Wade. \\n\\nShe was told her dream would have to wait. \\n\\nWhat her family has gone through should never have happened. And unless Congress acts, it could happen again. \\n\\nSo tonight, let’s stand up for families like hers! \\n\\nTo my friends across the aisle, don’t keep families waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF nationwide! \\n\\nLike most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right. And I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader, defending reproductive freedom and so much more. \\n\\nBut my predecessor came to office determined  \\n\\nto see Roe v. Wade overturned. \\n\\nHe’s the reason it was overturned. In fact, he brags about it. \\n\\nLook at the chaos that has resulted. \\n\\nJoining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother  \\n\\nfrom Dallas. \\n\\nWhen she became pregnant again, the fetus had a fatal condition. \\n\\nHer doctors told Kate that her own life and her ability to have children in the future were at risk if she didn’t act. \\n\\nBecause Texas law banned abortion, Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get the care she needed. \\n\\nWhat her family has gone through should never have happened as well. But it is happening to so many others. \\n\\nThere are state laws banning the right to choose, criminalizing doctors, and forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states as well to get the care they need. \\n\\nMany of you in this Chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom. \\n\\nMy God, what freedoms will you take away next? \\n\\nIn its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade the Supreme Court majority wrote, “Women are not without – \\n\\nelectoral or political power.” \\n\\nNo kidding. \\n\\nClearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. \\n\\nThey found out though when reproductive freedom   \\n\\nwas on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again, in 2024. \\n\\nIf Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again! \\n\\nAmerica cannot go back. I am here tonight to show the way forward. Because I know how far we’ve come. \\n\\nFour years ago next week, before I came to office, our country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a century. \\n\\nRemember the fear. Record job losses. Remember the spike in crime. And the murder rate. \\n\\nA raging virus that would take more than 1 million American lives and leave millions of loved ones behind. \\n\\nA mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness. \\n\\nA president, my predecessor, who failed the most basic duty. Any President owes the American people the duty to care. \\n\\nThat is unforgivable. \\n\\nI came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in our nation’s history. \\n\\nAnd we have.

The vaccines that saved us from COVID are now being used to help beat cancer. \\n\\nTurning setback into comeback. \\n\\nThat’s America! \\n\\nI inherited an economy that was on the brink.

That’s you, the American people! \\n\\nIt’s because of you America is coming back!  \\n\\nIt’s because of you, our future is brighter! \\n\\nAnd it’s because of you that tonight we can proudly say the State of our Union is strong and getting stronger!  \\n \\n\\nTonight I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together. \\n\\nA future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy| no place in America! \\n\\nHistory is watching. \\n\\nAnd history is watching another assault on freedom.  \\n\\nJoining us tonight is Latorya Beasley, a social worker from Birmingham, Alabama. 14 months ago tonight, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF. \\n\\nShe scheduled treatments to have a second child, but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the state, unleashed by the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. \\n\\nShe was told her dream would have to wait. \\n\\nWhat her family has gone through should never have happened. And unless Congress acts, it could happen again. \\n\\nSo tonight, let’s stand up for families like hers! \\n\\nTo my friends across the aisle, don’t keep families waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF nationwide! \\n\\nLike most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right. And I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader, defending reproductive freedom and so much more. \\n\\nBut my predecessor came to office determined  \\n\\nto see Roe v. Wade overturned. \\n\\nHe’s the reason it was overturned. In fact, he brags about it. \\n\\nLook at the chaos that has resulted. \\n\\nJoining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother  \\n\\nfrom Dallas. \\n\\nWhen she became pregnant again, the fetus had a fatal condition. \\n\\nHer doctors told Kate that her own life and her ability to have children in the future were at risk if she didn’t act. \\n\\nBecause Texas law banned abortion, Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get the care she needed. \\n\\nWhat her family has gone through should never have happened as well. But it is happening to so many others. \\n\\nThere are state laws banning the right to choose, criminalizing doctors, and forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states as well to get the care they need. \\n\\nMany of you in this Chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom. \\n\\nMy God, what freedoms will you take away next? \\n\\nIn its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade the Supreme Court majority wrote, “Women are not without – \\n\\nelectoral or political power.” \\n\\nNo kidding. \\n\\nClearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. \\n\\nThey found out though when reproductive freedom   \\n\\nwas on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again, in 2024. \\n\\nIf Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again! \\n\\nAmerica cannot go back. I am here tonight to show the way forward. Because I know how far we’ve come. \\n\\nFour years ago next week, before I came to office, our country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a century. \\n\\nRemember the fear. Record job losses. Remember the spike in crime. And the murder rate. \\n\\nA raging virus that would take more than 1 million American lives and leave millions of loved ones behind. \\n\\nA mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness. \\n\\nA president, my predecessor, who failed the most basic duty. Any President owes the American people the duty to care. \\n\\nThat is unforgivable. \\n\\nI came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in our nation’s history. \\n\\nAnd we have. It doesn’t make the news but in thousands of cities and towns the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told. \\n\\nSo let’s tell that story here and now. \\n\\nAmerica’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, investing in all of America, in all Americans to make sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind! \\n\\nThe pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccines that saved us from COVID are now being used to help beat cancer. \\n\\nTurning setback into comeback. \\n\\nThat’s America! \\n\\nI inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now our economy is the envy of the world! \\n\\n15 million new jobs in just three years – that’s a record! \\n\\nUnemployment at 50-year lows. \\n\\nA record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses and each one is an act of hope. \\n\\n'], retrieval_context=[], additional_metadata=None, comments=None, tools_called=None, expected_tools=None, reasoning=None, name=None),\n",

I can think of no more worthy investment.  I know of nothing that is more bipartisan.  So, let’s end cancer as we know it.  (Applause.)  It’s within our power.  (Applause.)  It’s within our power to do it.  (Applause.)\\n\\nInvestments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we’re talking about, have often had bipartisan support in the past.  Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan.  And I applaud a group of Republican senators who just put forward their own proposal.\\n\\nSo, let’s get to work.  I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the deep discussions.  I’d like to meet with those who have ideas that are different — they think are better.  I welcome those ideas. \\n\\nBut the rest of the world is not waiting for us.  I just want to be clear: From my perspective, doing nothing is not an option.  (Applause.)\\n\\nLook, we can’t be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.\\n\\nSecretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi — traveled over 17,000 miles with him', ' spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him.  When he called to congratulate me, we had a two-hour discussion.  He’s deadly earnest about becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world.  He and others — autocrats — think that democracy can’t compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus. \\n\\nTo win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children.  That’s why I’ve introduced the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.\\n\\nFirst is access to a good education.  When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.  It’s, I believe, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st — in the 20th century. \\n\\nBut the world has caught up, or catching up.  They are not waiting.  I would say, parenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, “Okay, we’re going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education,” I wonder whether we’d think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century.  I doubt it.  Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st Century.\\n\\nThat’s why my American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.\\n\\nThe great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years.  It shows that adding two years of universal high-quality preschool for every three-year-old and four-year-old, no matter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years.  It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduation.\\n\\nThe research shows when a young child goes to school — not daycare — they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.\\n\\nWhen you add two years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the dynamic.  (Applause.)  We can do that.  (Applause.) \\n\\nAnd we’ll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions.  The reason is: They don’t have the endowments, but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy — all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.\\n\\nJill was  a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady.  She has long said — (applause).  She has long — (applause).  If I’ve heard it once, I’ve heard it a thousand times: “Joe, any country that out-educates us is going to out|compete us.”  She’ll be deeply involved in leading this effort.  Thank you, Jill.\\n\\nSecond thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare.  We guarantee — (applause).  And I’m proposing a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5.  The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime.\\n\\nThird, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave  and medical leave — family and medical leave.  We’re one of the few industrial countries in the world — (applause). \\n\\nNo one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones –- a parent, a spouse, or child.\\n\\nAnd fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans.  In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family.  Up to a $3,000 per child if they’re under [over]* six years of age — I mean, excuse me — under — over six years of age, and $3,600 for children over [under]* six years of age.\\n\\nWith two parents, two kids, that’s $7,200 in the pockets that’s going to help to take care of your family.  And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child] poverty in half.  (Applause.)  And we can afford it. \\n\\nSo we did that in the rec- — in the — in the last piece of legislation we passed. But let’s extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025.  (Applause.)  \\n\\nThe American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act.  I know that’s really popular on this side of the aisle.  (Laughter.)  But let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up.  (Applause.)  \\n\\nIn addition to my Families Plan, I’m going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families. \\n\\nThe Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women’s health.  And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly — how badly it’s needed.  Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care — in the Affordable Care Act.  (Applause.)  And let’s lower prescription drug costs.  (Applause.) \\n\\nWe know how to do this.  The last President had that as an objective.  We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America. \\n\\nIn fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in America — nearly three times — for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay.  We have to change that, and we can. \\n\\nLet’s do what we’ve always talked about for all the years I was down here in this — in this body — in Congress.  Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd, by the way, that won’t just — that won’t just help people on Medicare', ' it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. \\n\\nAnd the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny.  It’s within our power to do it', ' let’s do it now.  (Applause.)\\n\\nWe’ve talked about it long enough.  Democrats and Republicans, let’s get it done this year.  This is all about a simple premise: Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege in America.  (Applause.) \\n\\nSo, how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan?  I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits.  Let’s start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000.  It’s — but it’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share.  (Applause.)  Just their fair share. \\n\\nSometimes I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party.  I think| products made in America to create American jobs.  That’s the way it’s supposed to be and it will be in this administration.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd I made it clear to all my Cabinet people.  Their ability to give exemptions has been exstrenuously [sic] limited.  It will be American products.\\n\\nNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you.  So many of you — so many of the folks I grew up with feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that’s so rapidly changing.  It’s frightening. \\n\\nI want to speak directly to you.  Because if you think about it, that’s what people are most worried about: “Can I fit in?”\\n\\nIndependent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come.  It is a — it is an eight-year program.  These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced.\\n\\nNearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree', ' 75 percent don’t require an associate’s degree.\\n\\nThe American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America.  That’s what it is.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd it recognizes something I’ve always said in this chamber and the other.  Good guys and women on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn’t build this country.  The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class.  (Applause.)\\n\\nSo that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Act — the PRO Act — and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd, by the way, while you’re thinking about sending things to my desk — (laughs) — let’s raise the minimum wage to $15.  (Applause.)\\n\\nNo one — no one working 40 hours a week — no one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line.\\n\\nWe need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women.  And while we’re doing this, let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as well — equal pay.  It’s been much too long.  And if you’re wondering whether it’s too long, look behind me.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record.  We will see more technological change — and some of you know more about this than I do — we’ll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50.  That’s how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.\\n\\nAnd we’re falling behind the competition with the rest of the world.\\n\\nDecades ago, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America — 2 percent of our gross domestic product — in research and development. \\n\\nToday, Mr. Secretary, that’s less than 1 percent.  China and other countries are closing in fast.  We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future:\\nadvanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.\\n\\nThe Secretary of Defense can tell you — and those of you on — who work on national security issues know — the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA — the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency.  The people who set up before I came here — and that’s been a long time ago — to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security -– that’s their only job.  And it’s a semi-separate agency', ' it’s under the Defense Department.  It’s led to everything from the discovery of the Internet to GPS and so much more that has enhanced our security.\\n\\nThe National Institute of Health — the NIH –- I believe, should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd that would — here’s what it would do.  It would have a singular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer.\\n\\nI’ll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President — almost $9 million going to NIH.  And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I’ll never forget you standing and mentioning — saying you’d name it after my deceased son.  It meant a lot.\\n\\n'], retrieval_context=[], additional_metadata=None, comments=None, tools_called=None, expected_tools=None, reasoning=None, name=None),\n",

Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \\n\\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \\n\\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.

The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. \\n\\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. \\n\\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. \\n\\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. \\n\\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation.

And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. \\n\\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. \\n\\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.  \\n\\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.  \\n\\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. \\n\\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. \\n\\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. \\n\\nIt’s| People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \\n\\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \\n\\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \\n\\nAnd with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \\n\\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \\n\\nOf course, continuing this costs money. \\n\\nI will soon send Congress a request. \\n\\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \\n\\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \\n\\nWe’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \\n\\nAnd we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19.

Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible.\\n\\nMaybe that’s you, watching at home.\\n\\nYou remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.\\n\\nI get it.\\n\\nThat’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind.\\n\\nJobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years.

Will you have to sell the house?\\n\\nI get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we’re taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night.\\n\\nYou know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth.\\n\\nFor example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.\\n\\nEvery day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make.\\n\\nBut, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.\\n\\nNot anymore.\\n\\nWe capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.\\n\\nBut there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives.\\n\\nLet’s finish the job this time.\\n\\nLet’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it.\\n\\nThis law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year.\\n\\nIf drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the difference.\\n\\nAnd we’re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn’t just save seniors money.\\n\\nIt will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare.\\n\\nWhy wouldn’t we want to do that?\\n\\nNow, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\\n\\nMake no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it.\\n\\nI’m pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in history.\\n\\nA record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.\\n|ve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.\\n\\nWhere is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again?\\n\\nFor too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs.\\n\\nNow, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs.\\n\\nInflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies.\\n\\nBut we’re better positioned than any country on Earth.\\n\\nWe have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.\\n\\nHere at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.\\n\\nFood inflation is coming down.\\n\\nInflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up.\\n\\nAdditionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small business.\\n\\nEvery time somebody starts a small business, it’s an act of hope.\\n\\nAnd the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted.\\n\\nStanding here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibility.\\n\\nSemiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more.

We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut down.\\n\\nToday’s automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers couldn’t make enough cars because there weren’t enough chips.\\n\\nCar prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones.\\n\\nWe can never let that happen again.\\n\\nThat’s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.\\n\\nWe’re making sure the supply chain for America begins in America.\\n\\nWe’ve already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law.\\n\\nWith this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country.\\n\\nThat’s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years.\\n\\nOutside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres – a literal field of dreams.\\n\\nThat’ll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.\\n\\nJobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don’t require a college degree.\\n\\nJobs where people don’t have to leave home in search of opportunity.\\n\\nAnd it’s just getting started.\\n\\nThink about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that will come to life.\\n\\nTalk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they’ll tell you what this means to their communities.\\n\\nWe’re seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland.\\n\\nBut to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best infrastructure in the world.\\n\\nWe used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th.\\n\\nNow we’re coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.\\n\\nAlready, we’ve funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland.\\n\\nThese projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and high-speed internet across America.\\n\\nUrban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal.\\n\\nAnd we’re just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law.\\n\\nAnd to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don’t worry.\\n\\nI promised to be the president for all Americans.\\n\\nWe’ll fund your projects.

But just pay your fair share.\\n\\nAnd I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is simply unfair.\\n\\nThe idea that in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes?\\n\\nThat’s simply not fair.\\n\\nBut now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%.\\n\\nJust 15%.\\n\\nThat’s less than a nurse pays. Let me be clear.\\n\\nUnder my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes.\\n\\nNobody. Not one penny.\\n\\nBut there’s more to do.\\n\\nLet’s finish the job. Reward work, not just wealth.

That’s pride.\\n\\nThat’s what we’re also building – Pride.\\n\\nWe’re also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers, so every child in America can drink clean water.\\n\\nWe’re making sure that every community has access to affordable, high-speed internet.\\n\\nNo parent should have to drive to a McDonald’s parking lot so their kid can do their homework online.\\n\\nAnd when we do these projects, we’re going to Buy American.\\n\\nBuy American has been the law of the land since 1933. But for too long, past administrations have found ways to get around it.\\n\\nNot anymore.\\n\\nTonight, I’m also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.\\n\\nAmerican-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables.\\n\\nAnd on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.\\n\\nMy economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible.\\n\\nMaybe that’s you, watching at home.\\n\\nYou remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.\\n\\nI get it.\\n\\nThat’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind.\\n\\nJobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.\\n\\nFor example, too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer, your child gets sick, or if something happens to you.\\n\\nWill you have the money to pay your medical bills? Will you have to sell the house?\\n\\nI get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we’re taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night.\\n\\nYou know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth.\\n\\nFor example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.\\n\\nEvery day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make.\\n\\nBut, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.\\n\\nNot anymore.\\n\\nWe capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.\\n\\nBut there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives.\\n\\nLet’s finish the job this time.\\n\\nLet’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it.\\n\\nThis law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year.\\n\\nIf drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the difference.\\n\\nAnd we’re finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn’t just save seniors money.\\n\\nIt will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare.\\n\\nWhy wouldn’t we want to do that?\\n\\nNow, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.\\n\\nMake no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it.\\n\\nI’m pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in history.\\n\\nA record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.\\n|ve already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.\\n\\nWhere is it written that America can’t lead the world in manufacturing again?\\n\\nFor too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs.\\n\\nNow, thanks to all we’ve done, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs.\\n\\nInflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin’s war that disrupted energy and food supplies.\\n\\nBut we’re better positioned than any country on Earth.\\n\\nWe have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.\\n\\nHere at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.\\n\\nFood inflation is coming down.\\n\\nInflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up.\\n\\nAdditionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small business.\\n\\nEvery time somebody starts a small business, it’s an act of hope.\\n\\nAnd the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted.\\n\\nStanding here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibility.\\n\\nSemiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more. These chips were invented right here in America.\\n\\nAmerica used to make nearly 40% of the world’s chips.\\n\\nBut in the last few decades, we lost our edge and we’re down to producing only 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut down.\\n\\nToday’s automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers couldn’t make enough cars because there weren’t enough chips.\\n\\nCar prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones.\\n\\nWe can never let that happen again.\\n\\nThat’s why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.\\n\\nWe’re making sure the supply chain for America begins in America.\\n\\nWe’ve already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law.\\n\\nWith this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country.\\n\\nThat’s going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years.\\n\\nOutside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres – a literal field of dreams.\\n\\nThat’ll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.\\n\\nJobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don’t require a college degree.\\n\\nJobs where people don’t have to leave home in search of opportunity.\\n\\nAnd it’s just getting started.\\n\\nThink about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that will come to life.\\n\\nTalk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they’ll tell you what this means to their communities.\\n\\nWe’re seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland.\\n\\nBut to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best infrastructure in the world.\\n\\nWe used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th.\\n\\nNow we’re coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower’s Interstate Highway System.\\n\\nAlready, we’ve funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland.\\n\\nThese projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and high-speed internet across America.\\n\\nUrban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal.\\n\\nAnd we’re just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law.\\n\\nAnd to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don’t worry.\\n\\nI promised to be the president for all Americans.\\n\\nWe’ll fund your projects. And I’ll see you at the ground-breaking.\\n\\nThis law will help further unite all of America.\\n\\nMajor projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs.\\n\\nOne of the nation’s most congested freight routes carrying $2 billion worth of freight every day. Folks have been talking|\\nThanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums.\\n\\nBut the way that law was written, that benefit expires after 2025.\\n\\nLet’s finish the job, make those savings permanent, and expand coverage to those left off Medicaid.\\n\\nLook, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis.\\n\\nLowering utility bills, creating American jobs, and leading the world to a clean energy future.\\n\\nI’ve visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts, storms and wildfires.\\n\\nIn addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we are rebuilding for the long term.\\n\\nNew electric grids able to weather the next major storm.\\n\\nRoads and water systems to withstand the next big flood.\\n\\nClean energy to cut pollution and create jobs in communities too often left behind.\\n\\nWe’re building 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations installed across the country by tens of thousands of IBEW workers.\\n\\nAnd helping families save more than $1,000 a year with tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles and energy-efficient appliances.\\n\\nHistoric conservation efforts to be responsible stewards of our lands.\\n\\nLet’s face reality.\\n\\nThe climate crisis doesn’t care if your state is red or blue. It is an existential threat.\\n\\nWe have an obligation to our children and grandchildren to confront it. I’m proud of how America is at last stepping up to the challenge.\\n\\nBut there’s so much more to do.\\n\\nWe will finish the job.\\n\\nAnd we pay for these investments in our future by finally making the wealthiest and the biggest corporations begin to pay their fair share.\\n\\nI’m a capitalist. But just pay your fair share.\\n\\nAnd I think a lot of you at home agree with me that our present tax system is simply unfair.\\n\\nThe idea that in 2020, 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes?\\n\\nThat’s simply not fair.\\n\\nBut now, because of the law I signed, billion-dollar companies have to pay a minimum of 15%.\\n\\nJust 15%.\\n\\nThat’s less than a nurse pays. Let me be clear.\\n\\nUnder my plan, nobody earning less than $400,000 a year will pay an additional penny in taxes.\\n\\nNobody. Not one penny.\\n\\nBut there’s more to do.\\n\\nLet’s finish the job. Reward work, not just wealth. Pass my proposal for a billionaire minimum tax.\\n\\nBecause no billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter.\\n\\nYou may have noticed that Big Oil just reported record profits.\\n\\nLast year, they made $200 billion in the midst of a global energy crisis.\\n\\nIt’s outrageous.\\n\\nThey invested too little of that profit to increase domestic production and keep gas prices down.\\n\\nInstead, they used those record profits to buy back their own stock, rewarding their CEOs and shareholders.\\n\\nCorporations ought to do the right thing.\\n\\nThat’s why I propose that we quadruple the tax on corporate stock buybacks to encourage long term investments instead.\\n\\nThey will still make a considerable profit.\\n\\nLet’s finish the job and close the loopholes that allow the very wealthy to avoid paying their taxes.\\n\\nInstead of cutting the number of audits of wealthy tax payers, I signed a law that will reduce the deficit by $114 billion by cracking down on wealthy tax cheats.\\n\\nThat’s being fiscally responsible.\\n\\nIn the last two years, my administration cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion – the largest deficit reduction in American history.\\n\\nUnder the previous administration, America’s deficit went up four years in a row.\\n\\nBecause of those record deficits, no president added more to the national debt in any four years than my predecessor.\\n\\nNearly 25% of the entire national debt, a debt that took 200 years to accumulate, was added by that administration alone.\\n\\nHow did Congress respond to all that debt?\\n\\nThey lifted the debt ceiling three times without preconditions or crisis.\\n\\nThey paid America’s bills to prevent economic disaster for our country.\\n\\nTonight, I’m asking this Congress to follow suit.\\n\\nLet us commit here tonight that the full faith and credit of the United States of America will never, ever be questioned.\\n\\nSome of my Republican friends want to take the economy hostage unless I agree to their economic plans.

Technology we have yet to invent. \\n\\nBut that’s just the beginning. \\n\\nIntel’s CEO, Pat Gelsinger, who is here tonight, told me they are ready to increase their investment from  \\n$20 billion to $100 billion. \\n\\nThat would be one of the biggest investments in manufacturing in American history. \\n\\nAnd all they’re waiting for is for you to pass this bill. \\n\\nSo let’s not wait any longer. Send it to my desk. I’ll sign it.  \\n\\nAnd we will really take off. \\n\\nAnd Intel is not alone. \\n\\nThere’s something happening in America. \\n\\nJust look around and you’ll see an amazing story. \\n\\nThe rebirth of the pride that comes from stamping products “Made In America.” The revitalization of American manufacturing.   \\n\\nCompanies are choosing to build new factories here, when just a few years ago, they would have built them overseas. \\n\\nThat’s what is happening. Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 11,000 jobs across the country. \\n\\nGM is making the largest investment in its history—$7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan. \\n\\nAll told, we created 369,000 new manufacturing jobs in America just last year. \\n\\nPowered by people I’ve met like JoJo Burgess, from generations of union steelworkers from Pittsburgh, who’s here with us tonight. \\n\\nAs Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown says, “It’s time to bury the label “Rust Belt.” \\n\\nIt’s time. \\n\\nBut with all the bright spots in our economy, record job growth and higher wages, too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills.  \\n\\nInflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel. \\n\\nI get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. \\n\\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories. \\n\\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains. \\n\\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up. \\n\\nLook at cars. \\n\\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. \\n\\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up. \\n\\nSo—we have a choice. \\n\\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.  \\n\\nI have a better plan to fight inflation. \\n\\nLower your costs, not your wages. \\n\\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America. \\n\\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America. \\n\\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America. \\n\\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America. \\n\\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America. \\n\\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” \\n\\nI call it building a better America. \\n\\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. \\n\\n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan: \\n\\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \\n\\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \\n\\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \\n\\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.  \\n\\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \\n\\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \\n\\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \\n\\nDrug companies will still do very well.

That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control. \\n\\nLook, our economy roared back faster than most predicted, but the pandemic meant that businesses had a hard time hiring enough workers to keep up production in their factories. \\n\\nThe pandemic also disrupted global supply chains. \\n\\nWhen factories close, it takes longer to make goods and get them from the warehouse to the store, and prices go up. \\n\\nLook at cars. \\n\\nLast year, there weren’t enough semiconductors to make all the cars that people wanted to buy. \\n\\nAnd guess what, prices of automobiles went up. \\n\\nSo—we have a choice. \\n\\nOne way to fight inflation is to drive down wages and make Americans poorer.  \\n\\nI have a better plan to fight inflation. \\n\\nLower your costs, not your wages. \\n\\nMake more cars and semiconductors in America. \\n\\nMore infrastructure and innovation in America. \\n\\nMore goods moving faster and cheaper in America. \\n\\nMore jobs where you can earn a good living in America. \\n\\nAnd instead of relying on foreign supply chains, let’s make it in America. \\n\\nEconomists call it “increasing the productive capacity of our economy.” \\n\\nI call it building a better America. \\n\\nMy plan to fight inflation will lower your costs and lower the deficit. \\n\\n17 Nobel laureates in economics say my plan will ease long-term inflationary pressures. Top business leaders and most Americans support my plan. And here’s the plan: \\n\\nFirst – cut the cost of prescription drugs. Just look at insulin. One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia, I met a 13-year-old boy named Joshua Davis.  \\n\\nHe and his Dad both have Type 1 diabetes, which means they need insulin every day. Insulin costs about $10 a vial to make.  \\n\\nBut drug companies charge families like Joshua and his Dad up to 30 times more. I spoke with Joshua’s mom. \\n\\nImagine what it’s like to look at your child who needs insulin and have no idea how you’re going to pay for it.  \\n\\nWhat it does to your dignity, your ability to look your child in the eye, to be the parent you expect to be. \\n\\nJoshua is here with us tonight. Yesterday was his birthday. Happy birthday, buddy.  \\n\\nFor Joshua, and for the 200,000 other young people with Type 1 diabetes, let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month so everyone can afford it.  \\n\\nDrug companies will still do very well.

Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.\\n\\nA story that is unique among all nations.\\n\\nWe are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.\\n\\nThat is what we are doing again.\\n\\nTwo years ago, our economy was reeling.\\n\\nAs I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.\\n\\nTwo years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.\\n\\nToday, COVID no longer controls our lives.\\n\\nAnd two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.\\n\\nToday, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.\\n\\nAs we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.\\n\\nYou know, we’re often told that Democrats and Republicans can’t work together.\\n\\nBut over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.\\n\\nYes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone.\\n\\nBut time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.\\n\\nCame together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.\\n\\nCame together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people.\\n\\nCame together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.\\n\\nIn fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.\\n\\nTo my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress.\\n\\nThe people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.\\n\\nAnd that’s always been my vision for our country.\\n\\nTo restore the soul of the nation.\\n\\nTo rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class.\\n\\nTo unite the country.\\n\\nWe’ve been sent here to finish the job.\\n\\nFor decades, the middle class was hollowed out.\\n\\nToo many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down.\\n\\nOnce-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.\\n\\nAnd along the way, something else was lost.\\n\\nPride. That sense of self-worth.\\n\\nI ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.\\n\\nTo build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.\\n\\nAs my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about your dignity. It’s about respect. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, “Honey –it’s going to be OK,” and mean it.\\n\\nSo, let’s look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.\\n\\nWe’', ' White House tonight.\\n\\nFor the lives we can save and for the lives we have lost, let this be a truly American moment that rallies the country and the world together and proves that we can do big things.\\n\\nTwenty years ago, under the leadership of President Bush and countless advocates and champions, we undertook a bipartisan effort through PEPFAR to transform the global fight against HIV/AIDS. It’s been a huge success.\\n\\nI believe we can do the same with cancer.\\n\\nLet’s end cancer as we know it and cure some cancers once and for all.\\n\\nThere’s one reason why we’re able to do all of these things: our democracy itself.\\n\\nIt’s the most fundamental thing of all.\\n\\nWith democracy, everything is possible. Without it, nothing is.\\n\\nFor the last few years our democracy has been threatened, attacked, and put at risk.\\n\\nPut to the test here, in this very room, on January 6th.\\n\\nAnd then, just a few months ago, unhinged by the Big Lie, an assailant unleashed political violence in the home of the then-Speaker of this House of Representatives.

There is no place for political violence in America. In America, we must protect the right to vote, not suppress that fundamental right.

We must uphold the rule of the law and restore trust in our institutions of democracy.\\n\\nAnd we must give hate and extremism in any form no safe harbor.\\n\\nDemocracy must not be a partisan issue. It must be an American issue.\\n\\nEvery generation of Americans has faced a moment where they have been called on to protect our democracy, to defend it, to stand up for it.\\n\\nAnd this is our moment.\\n\\nMy fellow Americans, we meet tonight at an inflection point. One of those moments that only a few generations ever face, where the decisions we make now will decide the course of this nation and of the world for decades to come.\\n\\nWe are not bystanders to history. We are not powerless before the forces that confront us. It is within our power, of We the People. We are facing the test of our time and the time for choosing is at hand.\\n\\nWe must be the nation we have always been at our best. Optimistic. Hopeful. Forward-looking.\\n\\nA nation that embraces, light over darkness, hope over fear, unity over division. Stability over chaos.\\n\\nWe must see each other not as enemies, but as fellow Americans.

A nation in a new age of possibilities.\\n\\nSo I have come here to fulfil my constitutional duty to report on the state of the union. And here is my report.\\n\\nBecause the soul of this nation is strong, because the backbone of this nation is strong, because the people of this nation are strong, the State of the Union is strong.\\n\\nAs I stand here tonight, I have never been more optimistic about the future of America.

May God protect our troops.', '’s finish the job and ban assault weapons again.\\n\\nAnd let’s also come together on immigration and make it a bipartisan issue like it was before.\\n\\nWe now have a record number of personnel working to secure the border, arresting 8,000 human smugglers and seizing over 23,000 pounds of fentanyl in just the last several months.\\n\\nSince we launched our new border plan last month, unlawful migration from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela has come down 97%.\\n\\nBut America’s border problems won’t be fixed until Congress acts.\\n\\nIf you won’t pass my comprehensive immigration reform, at least pass my plan to provide the equipment and officers to secure the border. And a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers.\\n\\nHere in the people’s House, it’s our duty to protect all the people’s rights and freedoms.\\n\\nCongress must restore the right the Supreme Court took away last year and codify Roe v. Wade to protect every woman’s constitutional right to choose.\\n\\nThe Vice President and I are doing everything we can to protect access to reproductive health care and safeguard patient privacy. But already, more than a dozen states are enforcing extreme abortion bans.\\n\\nMake no mistake; if Congress passes a national abortion ban, I will veto it.\\n\\nLet’s also pass the bipartisan Equality Act to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity.\\n\\nOur strength is not just the example of our power, but the power of our example.

One year later, we know the answer.\\n\\nYes, we would.\\n\\nAnd yes, we did.\\n\\nTogether, we did what America always does at our best.\\n\\nWe led.\\n\\nWe united NATO and built a global coalition.\\n\\nWe stood against Putin’s aggression.\\n\\nWe stood with the Ukrainian people.\\n\\nTonight, we are once again joined by Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States.

And together, we succeeded! \\n\\nInstead of an auto factory shutting down an auto factory is re-opening and a new state-of-the art battery factory is being built to power those cars. \\n\\nInstead of a town being left behind it’s a community moving forward again! \\n\\nBecause instead of watching auto jobs of the future go overseas 4,000 union workers with higher wages will be building that future, in Belvidere, here in America! \\n\\nHere tonight is UAW President, Shawn Fain, a great friend, and a great labor leader. \\n\\nAnd Dawn Simms, a third generation UAW worker  in Belvidere. \\n\\nShawn, I was proud to be the first President in American history to walk a picket line. \\n\\nAnd today Dawn has a job in her hometown providing stability for her family and pride and dignity. \\n\\nShowing once again, Wall Street didn’t build this country! \\n\\nThe middle class built this country! And unions built the middle class! \\n\\nWhen Americans get knocked down, we get back up! \\n\\nWe keep going! \\n\\nThat’s America! That’s you, the American people! \\n\\nIt’s because of you America is coming back!  \\n\\nIt’s because of you, our future is brighter! \\n\\nAnd it’s because of you that tonight we can proudly say the State of our Union is strong and getting stronger!  \\n \\n\\nTonight I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together. \\n\\nA future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy', ' no place in America! \\n\\nHistory is watching. \\n\\nAnd history is watching another assault on freedom.  \\n\\nJoining us tonight is Latorya Beasley, a social worker from Birmingham, Alabama. 14 months ago tonight, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF. \\n\\nShe scheduled treatments to have a second child, but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the state, unleashed by the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. \\n\\nShe was told her dream would have to wait. \\n\\nWhat her family has gone through should never have happened. And unless Congress acts, it could happen again. \\n\\nSo tonight, let’s stand up for families like hers! \\n\\nTo my friends across the aisle, don’t keep families waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF nationwide! \\n\\nLike most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right. And I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader, defending reproductive freedom and so much more. \\n\\nBut my predecessor came to office determined  \\n\\nto see Roe v. Wade overturned. \\n\\nHe’s the reason it was overturned. In fact, he brags about it. \\n\\nLook at the chaos that has resulted. \\n\\nJoining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother  \\n\\nfrom Dallas. \\n\\nWhen she became pregnant again, the fetus had a fatal condition. \\n\\nHer doctors told Kate that her own life and her ability to have children in the future were at risk if she didn’t act. \\n\\nBecause Texas law banned abortion, Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get the care she needed. \\n\\nWhat her family has gone through should never have happened as well. But it is happening to so many others. \\n\\nThere are state laws banning the right to choose, criminalizing doctors, and forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states as well to get the care they need. \\n\\nMany of you in this Chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom. \\n\\nMy God, what freedoms will you take away next? \\n\\nIn its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade the Supreme Court majority wrote, “Women are not without – \\n\\nelectoral or political power.” \\n\\nNo kidding. \\n\\nClearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. \\n\\nThey found out though when reproductive freedom   \\n\\nwas on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again, in 2024. \\n\\nIf Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again! \\n\\nAmerica cannot go back. I am here tonight to show the way forward. Because I know how far we’ve come. \\n\\nFour years ago next week, before I came to office, our country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a century. \\n\\nRemember the fear. Record job losses. Remember the spike in crime. And the murder rate. \\n\\nA raging virus that would take more than 1 million American lives and leave millions of loved ones behind. \\n\\nA mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness. \\n\\nA president, my predecessor, who failed the most basic duty. Any President owes the American people the duty to care. \\n\\nThat is unforgivable. \\n\\nI came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in our nation’s history. \\n\\nAnd we have. It doesn’t make the news but in thousands of cities and towns the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told. \\n\\nSo let’s tell that story here and now. \\n\\nAmerica’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, investing in all of America, in all Americans to make sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind! \\n\\nThe pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccines that saved us from COVID are now being used to help beat cancer. \\n\\nTurning setback into comeback. \\n\\nThat’s America! \\n\\nI inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now our economy is the envy of the world! \\n\\n15 million new jobs in just three years – that’s a record! \\n\\nUnemployment at 50-year lows. \\n\\nA record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses and each one is an act of hope. \\n\\n'], retrieval_context=None, additional_metadata=None, comments=None, source_file='Speeches/titleedits/state_of_the_union_030724.txt'), Golden(input=\"Analyze how the speech's focus on American jobs aligns with historical trends in American political discourse.\", actual_output=None, expected_output=None, context=['With historic job growth and small business growth for Black, Hispanic, and Asian-Americans. \\n\\n800,000 new manufacturing jobs in America and counting. \\n\\nMore people have health insurance today than ever before. \\n\\nThe racial wealth gap is the smallest it’s been in 20 years. \\n\\nWages keep going up and inflation keeps coming down! \\n\\nInflation has dropped from 9% to 3% – the lowest in the world! \\n\\nAnd trending lower. \\n\\nAnd now instead of importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs – right here in America where they belong! \\n \\n \\n\\nAnd the American people are beginning to feel it. \\n\\nConsumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring. \\n\\nBuy American has been the law of the land since the 1930s.  \\n \\n\\nPast administrations including my predecessor failed to Buy American. \\n\\nNot any more. \\n\\nOn my watch, federal projects like helping to build American roads bridges and highways will be made with American products built by American workers creating good-paying American jobs! \\n\\nThanks to my Chips and Science Act the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before. \\n\\nDuring the pandemic a shortage of semiconductor chips drove up prices for everything from cell phones to automobiles.  \\n\\nWell instead of having to import semiconductor chips, which America invented I might add, private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America! \\n\\nCreating tens of thousands of jobs many of them paying over $100,000 a year and don’t require a college degree. \\n\\nIn fact my policies have attracted $650 Billion of private sector investments in clean energy and advanced manufacturing creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America! \\n\\nThanks to our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 46,000 new projects have been announced across your communities – modernizing our roads and bridges, ports and airports, and public transit systems. \\n\\nRemoving poisonous lead pipes so every child can drink clean water without risk of getting brain damage. \\n\\nProviding affordable high speed internet for every American no matter where you live. \\n\\nUrban, suburban, and rural communities — in red states and blue. \\n\\nRecord investments in tribal communities. \\n\\nBecause of my investments, family farms are better be able to stay in the family and children and grandchildren won’t have to leave home to make a living.  \\n\\nIt’s transformative.  \\n\\n \\nA great comeback story is Belvidere, Illinois.

I can think of no more worthy investment.  I know of nothing that is more bipartisan.  So, let’s end cancer as we know it.  (Applause.)  It’s within our power.  (Applause.)  It’s within our power to do it.  (Applause.)\\n\\nInvestments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we’re talking about, have often had bipartisan support in the past.  Vice President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan.  And I applaud a group of Republican senators who just put forward their own proposal.\\n\\nSo, let’s get to work.  I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the deep discussions.  I’d like to meet with those who have ideas that are different — they think are better.  I welcome those ideas. \\n\\nBut the rest of the world is not waiting for us.  I just want to be clear: From my perspective, doing nothing is not an option.  (Applause.)\\n\\nLook, we can’t be so busy competing with one another that we forget the competition that we have with the rest of the world to win the 21st century.\\n\\nSecretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi — traveled over 17,000 miles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him.  When he called to congratulate me, we had a two-hour discussion.  He’s deadly earnest about becoming the most significant, consequential nation in the world.  He and others — autocrats — think that democracy can’t compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus. \\n\\nTo win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children.  That’s why I’ve introduced the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.\\n\\nFirst is access to a good education.  When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated, best-prepared nation in the world.  It’s, I believe, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st — in the 20th century. \\n\\nBut the world has caught up, or catching up.  They are not waiting.  I would say, parenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, “Okay, we’re going to decide what we do in terms of government providing for free education,” I wonder whether we’d think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century.  I doubt it.  Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st Century.\\n\\nThat’s why my American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America, starting as early as we can.\\n\\nThe great universities of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years.  It shows that adding two years of universal high-quality preschool for every three-year-old and four-year-old, no matter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the way through 12 years.  It increases exponentially their prospect of graduating and going on beyond graduation.\\n\\nThe research shows when a young child goes to school — not daycare — they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.\\n\\nWhen you add two years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the dynamic.  (Applause.)  We can do that.  (Applause.) \\n\\nAnd we’ll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges, Minority-Serving Institutions.  The reason is: They don’t have the endowments, but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy — all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.\\n\\nJill was  a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady.  She has long said — (applause).  She has long — (applause).  If I’ve heard it once, I’ve heard it a thousand times: “Joe, any country that out-educates us is going to out', 'compete us.”  She’ll be deeply involved in leading this effort.  Thank you, Jill.\\n\\nSecond thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare.  We guarantee — (applause).  And I’m proposing a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5.  The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime.\\n\\nThird, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave  and medical leave — family and medical leave.  We’re one of the few industrial countries in the world — (applause). \\n\\nNo one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones –- a parent, a spouse, or child.\\n\\nAnd fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans.  In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family.  Up to a $3,000 per child if they’re under [over]* six years of age — I mean, excuse me — under — over six years of age, and $3,600 for children over [under]* six years of age.\\n\\nWith two parents, two kids, that’s $7,200 in the pockets that’s going to help to take care of your family.  And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child] poverty in half.  (Applause.)  And we can afford it. \\n\\nSo we did that in the rec- — in the — in the last piece of legislation we passed. But let’s extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025.  (Applause.)  \\n\\nThe American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act.  I know that’s really popular on this side of the aisle.  (Laughter.)  But let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up.  (Applause.)  \\n\\nIn addition to my Families Plan, I’m going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families. \\n\\nThe Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women’s health.  And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly — how badly it’s needed.  Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care — in the Affordable Care Act.  (Applause.)  And let’s lower prescription drug costs.  (Applause.) \\n\\nWe know how to do this.  The last President had that as an objective.  We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America. \\n\\nIn fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in America — nearly three times — for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay.  We have to change that, and we can. \\n\\nLet’s do what we’ve always talked about for all the years I was down here in this — in this body — in Congress.  Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd, by the way, that won’t just — that won’t just help people on Medicare; it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. \\n\\nAnd the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny.  It’s within our power to do it; let’s do it now.  (Applause.)\\n\\nWe’ve talked about it long enough.  Democrats and Republicans, let’s get it done this year.  This is all about a simple premise: Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege in America.  (Applause.) \\n\\nSo, how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan?  I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits.  Let’s start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000.  It’s — but it’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share.  (Applause.)  Just their fair share. \\n\\nSometimes I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party.  I think', ' products made in America to create American jobs.  That’s the way it’s supposed to be and it will be in this administration.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd I made it clear to all my Cabinet people.  Their ability to give exemptions has been exstrenuously [sic] limited.  It will be American products.\\n\\nNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you.  So many of you — so many of the folks I grew up with feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that’s so rapidly changing.  It’s frightening. \\n\\nI want to speak directly to you.  Because if you think about it, that’s what people are most worried about: “Can I fit in?”\\n\\nIndependent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come.  It is a — it is an eight-year program.  These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced.\\n\\nNearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree; 75 percent don’t require an associate’s degree.\\n\\nThe American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America.  That’s what it is.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd it recognizes something I’ve always said in this chamber and the other.  Good guys and women on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn’t build this country.  The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class.  (Applause.)\\n\\nSo that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Act — the PRO Act — and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd, by the way, while you’re thinking about sending things to my desk — (laughs) — let’s raise the minimum wage to $15.  (Applause.)\\n\\nNo one — no one working 40 hours a week — no one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line.\\n\\nWe need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women.  And while we’re doing this, let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as well — equal pay.  It’s been much too long.  And if you’re wondering whether it’s too long, look behind me.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record.  We will see more technological change — and some of you know more about this than I do — we’ll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50.  That’s how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.\\n\\nAnd we’re falling behind the competition with the rest of the world.\\n\\nDecades ago, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America — 2 percent of our gross domestic product — in research and development. \\n\\nToday, Mr. Secretary, that’s less than 1 percent.  China and other countries are closing in fast.  We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future:\\nadvanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.\\n\\nThe Secretary of Defense can tell you — and those of you on — who work on national security issues know — the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA — the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency.  The people who set up before I came here — and that’s been a long time ago — to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security -– that’s their only job.  And it’s a semi-separate agency; it’s under the Defense Department.  It’s led to everything from the discovery of the Internet to GPS and so much more that has enhanced our security.\\n\\nThe National Institute of Health — the NIH –- I believe, should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd that would — here’s what it would do.  It would have a singular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer.\\n\\nI’ll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President — almost $9 million going to NIH.  And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I’ll never forget you standing and mentioning — saying you’d name it after my deceased son.  It meant a lot.\\n\\n'], retrieval_context=None, additional_metadata=None, comments=None, source_file='Speeches/titleedits/state_of_the_union_042921.txt'), Golden(input=\"Considering the president's focus on competing with other nations, how might bipartisan support for crucial initiatives affect America's global standing?\", actual_output=None, expected_output=None, context=['But so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who died of cancer.

The reason is: They don’t have the endowments, but their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy — all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.\\n\\nJill was  a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady.  She has long said — (applause).  She has long — (applause).  If I’ve heard it once, I’ve heard it a thousand times: “Joe, any country that out-educates us is going to out', 'compete us.”  She’ll be deeply involved in leading this effort.  Thank you, Jill.\\n\\nSecond thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable childcare.  We guarantee — (applause).  And I’m proposing a legislation to guarantee that low- and middle-income families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5.  The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime.\\n\\nThird, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid leave  and medical leave — family and medical leave.  We’re one of the few industrial countries in the world — (applause). \\n\\nNo one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their loved ones –- a parent, a spouse, or child.\\n\\nAnd fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of Americans.  In March, we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family.  Up to a $3,000 per child if they’re under [over]* six years of age — I mean, excuse me — under — over six years of age, and $3,600 for children over [under]* six years of age.\\n\\nWith two parents, two kids, that’s $7,200 in the pockets that’s going to help to take care of your family.  And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child] poverty in half.  (Applause.)  And we can afford it. \\n\\nSo we did that in the rec- — in the — in the last piece of legislation we passed. But let’s extend that Child Care Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025.  (Applause.)  \\n\\nThe American Rescue Plan lowered healthcare premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act.  I know that’s really popular on this side of the aisle.  (Laughter.)  But let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up.  (Applause.)  \\n\\nIn addition to my Families Plan, I’m going to work with Congress to address, this year, other critical priorities for American families. \\n\\nThe Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women’s health.  And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly — how badly it’s needed.  Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care — in the Affordable Care Act.  (Applause.)  And let’s lower prescription drug costs.  (Applause.) \\n\\nWe know how to do this.  The last President had that as an objective.  We all know how outrageously expensive drugs are in America. \\n\\nIn fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices of anywhere in the world right here in America — nearly three times — for the same drug, nearly three times what other countries pay.  We have to change that, and we can. \\n\\nLet’s do what we’ve always talked about for all the years I was down here in this — in this body — in Congress.  Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd, by the way, that won’t just — that won’t just help people on Medicare; it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. \\n\\nAnd the money we save, which is billions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny.  It’s within our power to do it; let’s do it now.  (Applause.)\\n\\nWe’ve talked about it long enough.  Democrats and Republicans, let’s get it done this year.  This is all about a simple premise: Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege in America.  (Applause.) \\n\\nSo, how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan?  I made it clear, we can do it without increasing the deficits.  Let’s start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on people making less than $400,000.  It’s — but it’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair share.  (Applause.)  Just their fair share. \\n\\nSometimes I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party.  I think', ' products made in America to create American jobs.  That’s the way it’s supposed to be and it will be in this administration.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd I made it clear to all my Cabinet people.  Their ability to give exemptions has been exstrenuously [sic] limited.  It will be American products.\\n\\nNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you.  So many of you — so many of the folks I grew up with feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that’s so rapidly changing.  It’s frightening. \\n\\nI want to speak directly to you.  Because if you think about it, that’s what people are most worried about: “Can I fit in?”\\n\\nIndependent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars to economic growth in the years to come.  It is a — it is an eight-year program.  These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced.\\n\\nNearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree; 75 percent don’t require an associate’s degree.\\n\\nThe American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America.  That’s what it is.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd it recognizes something I’ve always said in this chamber and the other.  Good guys and women on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn’t build this country.  The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class.  (Applause.)\\n\\nSo that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protect the Right to Organize Act — the PRO Act — and send it to my desk so we can support the right to unionize.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd, by the way, while you’re thinking about sending things to my desk — (laughs) — let’s raise the minimum wage to $15.  (Applause.)\\n\\nNo one — no one working 40 hours a week — no one working 40 hours a week should live below the poverty line.\\n\\nWe need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women.  And while we’re doing this, let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk as well — equal pay.  It’s been much too long.  And if you’re wondering whether it’s too long, look behind me.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and development on record.  We will see more technological change — and some of you know more about this than I do — we’ll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the last 50.  That’s how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.\\n\\nAnd we’re falling behind the competition with the rest of the world.\\n\\nDecades ago, we used to invest 2 percent of our gross domestic product in America — 2 percent of our gross domestic product — in research and development. \\n\\nToday, Mr. Secretary, that’s less than 1 percent.  China and other countries are closing in fast.  We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future:\\nadvanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.\\n\\nThe Secretary of Defense can tell you — and those of you on — who work on national security issues know — the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA — the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency.  The people who set up before I came here — and that’s been a long time ago — to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security -– that’s their only job.  And it’s a semi-separate agency; it’s under the Defense Department.  It’s led to everything from the discovery of the Internet to GPS and so much more that has enhanced our security.\\n\\nThe National Institute of Health — the NIH –- I believe, should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health.  (Applause.)\\n\\nAnd that would — here’s what it would do.  It would have a singular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer.\\n\\nI’ll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President — almost $9 million going to NIH.  And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I’ll never forget you standing and mentioning — saying you’d name it after my deceased son.  It meant a lot.\\n\\n'], retrieval_context=None, additional_metadata=None, comments=None, source_file='Speeches/titleedits/state_of_the_union_042921.txt'), Golden(input='Who is the retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court mentioned in the text, and what is his contribution to the country?', actual_output=None, expected_output=None, context=[' someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Justice Breyer, thank you for your service. \\n\\nOne of the most serious constitutional responsibilities a President has is nominating someone to serve on the United States Supreme Court. \\n\\nAnd I did that 4 days ago, when I nominated Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson.

And from a family of public school educators and police officers. A consensus builder.

At our border, we’ve installed new technology like cutting-edge scanners to better detect drug smuggling.  \\n\\nWe’ve set up joint patrols with Mexico and Guatemala to catch more human traffickers.  \\n\\nWe’re putting in place dedicated immigration judges so families fleeing persecution and violence can have their cases heard faster. \\n\\nWe’re securing commitments and supporting partners in South and Central America to host more refugees and secure their own borders. \\n\\nWe can do all this while keeping lit the torch of liberty that has led generations of immigrants to this land—my forefathers and so many of yours. \\n\\nProvide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, those on temporary status, farm workers, and essential workers. \\n\\nRevise our laws so businesses have the workers they need and families don’t wait decades to reunite. \\n\\nIt’s not only the right thing to do—it’s the economically smart thing to do. \\n\\nThat’s why immigration reform is supported by everyone from labor unions to religious leaders to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \\n\\nLet’s get it done once and for all. \\n\\nAdvancing liberty and justice also requires protecting the rights of women. \\n\\nThe constitutional right affirmed in Roe v. Wade—standing precedent for half a century—is under attack as never before. \\n\\nIf we want to go forward—not backward—we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman’s right to choose. And let’s continue to advance maternal health care in America. \\n\\nAnd for our LGBTQ+ Americans, let’s finally get the bipartisan Equality Act to my desk. The onslaught of state laws targeting transgender Americans and their families is wrong. \\n\\nAs I said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I will always have your back as your President, so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential. \\n\\nWhile it often appears that we never agree, that isn’t true. I signed 80 bipartisan bills into law last year. From preventing government shutdowns to protecting Asian-Americans from still-too-common hate crimes to reforming military justice. \\n\\nAnd soon, we’ll strengthen the Violence Against Women Act that I first wrote three decades ago. It is important for us to show the nation that we can come together and do big things. \\n\\nSo tonight I’m offering a Unity Agenda for the Nation. Four big things we can do together.  \\n\\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic. \\n\\nThere is so much we can do. Increase funding for prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and recovery.  \\n\\nGet rid of outdated rules that stop doctors from prescribing treatments. And stop the flow of illicit drugs by working with state and local law enforcement to go after traffickers. \\n\\nIf you’re suffering from addiction, know you are not alone. I believe in recovery, and I celebrate the 23 million Americans in recovery. \\n\\nSecond, let’s take on mental health. Especially among our children, whose lives and education have been turned upside down.  \\n\\nThe American Rescue Plan gave schools money to hire teachers and help students make up for lost learning.  \\n\\nI urge every parent to make sure your school does just that. And we can all play a part—sign up to be a tutor or a mentor. \\n\\nChildren were also struggling before the pandemic. Bullying, violence, trauma, and the harms of social media. \\n\\nAs Frances Haugen, who is here with us tonight, has shown, we must hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit. \\n\\nIt’s', ' People working from home can feel safe to begin to return to the office.   \\n\\nWe’re doing that here in the federal government. The vast majority of federal workers will once again work in person. \\n\\nOur schools are open. Let’s keep it that way. Our kids need to be in school. \\n\\nAnd with 75% of adult Americans fully vaccinated and hospitalizations down by 77%, most Americans can remove their masks, return to work, stay in the classroom, and move forward safely. \\n\\nWe achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks. \\n\\nOf course, continuing this costs money. \\n\\nI will soon send Congress a request. \\n\\nThe vast majority of Americans have used these tools and may want to again, so I expect Congress to pass it quickly.   \\n\\nFourth, we will continue vaccinating the world.     \\n\\nWe’ve sent 475 Million vaccine doses to 112 countries, more than any other nation. \\n\\nAnd we won’t stop. \\n\\nWe have lost so much to COVID-19. Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life. \\n\\nLet’s use this moment to reset. Let’s stop looking at COVID-19 as a partisan dividing line and see it for what it is: A God-awful disease.  \\n\\nLet’s stop seeing each other as enemies, and start seeing each other for who we really are: Fellow Americans.  \\n\\nWe can’t change how divided we’ve been. But we can change how we move forward—on COVID-19 and other issues we must face together. \\n\\nI recently visited the New York City Police Department days after the funerals of Officer Wilbert Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera. \\n\\nThey were responding to a 9-1-1 call when a man shot and killed them with a stolen gun. \\n\\nOfficer Mora was 27 years old. \\n\\nOfficer Rivera was 22. \\n\\nBoth Dominican Americans who’d grown up on the same streets they later chose to patrol as police officers. \\n\\nI spoke with their families and told them that we are forever in debt for their sacrifice, and we will carry on their mission to restore the trust and safety every community deserves. \\n\\nI’ve worked on these issues a long time. \\n\\nI know what works: Investing in crime preventionand community police officers who’ll walk the beat, who’ll know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety. \\n\\nSo let’s not abandon our streets. Or choose between safety and equal justice. \\n\\nLet’s come together to protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable. \\n\\nThat’s why the Justice Department required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knock warrants for its officers. \\n\\nThat’s why the American Rescue Plan provided $350 Billion that cities, states, and counties can use to hire more police and invest in proven strategies like community violence interruption—trusted messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people hope.  \\n\\nWe should all agree: The answer is not to Defund the police. The answer is to FUND the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. \\n\\nI ask Democrats and Republicans alike: Pass my budget and keep our neighborhoods safe.  \\n\\nAnd I will keep doing everything in my power to crack down on gun trafficking and ghost guns you can buy online and make at home—they have no serial numbers and can’t be traced. \\n\\nAnd I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun violence. Pass universal background checks. Why should anyone on a terrorist list be able to purchase a weapon? \\n\\nBan assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. \\n\\nRepeal the liability shield that makes gun manufacturers the only industry in America that can’t be sued. \\n\\nThese laws don’t infringe on the Second Amendment. They save lives. \\n\\nThe most fundamental right in America is the right to vote – and to have it counted. And it’s under assault. \\n\\nIn state after state, new laws have been passed, not only to suppress the vote, but to subvert entire elections. \\n\\nWe cannot let this happen. \\n\\nTonight. I call on the Senate to: Pass the Freedom to Vote Act. Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. And while you’re at it, pass the Disclose Act so Americans can know who is funding our elections. \\n\\nTonight, I’d like to honor'], retrieval_context=None, additional_metadata=None, comments=None, source_file='Speeches/titleedits/state_of_the_union_030122.txt'), Golden(input=\"Considering the President's statement, who was nominated to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice Breyer?\", actual_output=None, expected_output=None, context=[' someone who has dedicated his life to serve this country: Justice Stephen Breyer—an Army veteran, Constitutional scholar, and retiring Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

Will you have to sell the house?\\n\\nI get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we’re taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night.\\n\\nYou know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth.\\n\\nFor example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.\\n\\nEvery day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive.

Wade. \\n\\nShe was told her dream would have to wait. \\n\\nWhat her family has gone through should never have happened. And unless Congress acts, it could happen again. \\n\\nSo tonight, let’s stand up for families like hers! \\n\\nTo my friends across the aisle, don’t keep families waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF nationwide! \\n\\nLike most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right. And I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader, defending reproductive freedom and so much more. \\n\\nBut my predecessor came to office determined  \\n\\nto see Roe v.

But it is happening to so many others. \\n\\nThere are state laws banning the right to choose, criminalizing doctors, and forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states as well to get the care they need. \\n\\nMany of you in this Chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom. \\n\\nMy God, what freedoms will you take away next? \\n\\nIn its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade the Supreme Court majority wrote, “Women are not without – \\n\\nelectoral or political power.” \\n\\nNo kidding. \\n\\nClearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. \\n\\nThey found out though when reproductive freedom   \\n\\nwas on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again, in 2024. \\n\\nIf Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v.

Because I know how far we’ve come. \\n\\nFour years ago next week, before I came to office, our country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a century. \\n\\nRemember the fear. Record job losses. Remember the spike in crime. And the murder rate. \\n\\nA raging virus that would take more than 1 million American lives and leave millions of loved ones behind. \\n\\nA mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness. \\n\\nA president, my predecessor, who failed the most basic duty.

It doesn’t make the news but in thousands of cities and towns the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told. \\n\\nSo let’s tell that story here and now. \\n\\nAmerica’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, investing in all of America, in all Americans to make sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind! \\n\\nThe pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccines that saved us from COVID are now being used to help beat cancer. \\n\\nTurning setback into comeback. \\n\\nThat’s America! \\n\\nI inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now our economy is the envy of the world! \\n\\n15 million new jobs in just three years – that’s a record! \\n\\nUnemployment at 50-year lows. \\n\\nA record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses and each one is an act of hope. \\n\\n'], retrieval_context=None, additional_metadata=None, comments=None, source_file='Speeches/titleedits/state_of_the_union_030724.txt'), Golden(input=\"Analyze how the administration's actions, including job growth, economic improvements, and social policies, have addressed the needs and concerns of all Americans, particularly diverse communities.\", actual_output=None, expected_output=None, context=['With historic job growth and small business growth for Black, Hispanic, and Asian-Americans. \\n\\n800,000 new manufacturing jobs in America and counting. \\n\\nMore people have health insurance today than ever before. \\n\\nThe racial wealth gap is the smallest it’s been in 20 years. \\n\\nWages keep going up and inflation keeps coming down! \\n\\nInflation has dropped from 9% to 3% – the lowest in the world! \\n\\nAnd trending lower. \\n\\nAnd now instead of importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs – right here in America where they belong! \\n \\n \\n\\nAnd the American people are beginning to feel it. \\n\\nConsumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring. \\n\\nBuy American has been the law of the land since the 1930s.  \\n \\n\\nPast administrations including my predecessor failed to Buy American. \\n\\nNot any more. \\n\\nOn my watch, federal projects like helping to build American roads bridges and highways will be made with American products built by American workers creating good-paying American jobs! \\n\\nThanks to my Chips and Science Act the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before. \\n\\nDuring the pandemic a shortage of semiconductor chips drove up prices for everything from cell phones to automobiles.  \\n\\nWell instead of having to import semiconductor chips, which America invented I might add, private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America! \\n\\nCreating tens of thousands of jobs many of them paying over $100,000 a year and don’t require a college degree. \\n\\nIn fact my policies have attracted $650 Billion of private sector investments in clean energy and advanced manufacturing creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America! \\n\\nThanks to our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 46,000 new projects have been announced across your communities – modernizing our roads and bridges, ports and airports, and public transit systems. \\n\\nRemoving poisonous lead pipes so every child can drink clean water without risk of getting brain damage. \\n\\nProviding affordable high speed internet for every American no matter where you live. \\n\\nUrban, suburban, and rural communities — in red states and blue. \\n\\nRecord investments in tribal communities. \\n\\nBecause of my investments, family farms are better be able to stay in the family and children and grandchildren won’t have to leave home to make a living.  \\n\\nIt’s transformative.  \\n\\n \\nA great comeback story is Belvidere, Illinois. Home to an auto plant for nearly 60 years.  \\n \\n\\nBefore I came to office the plant was on its way to shutting down. \\n\\n \\nThousands of workers feared for their livelihoods. Hope was fading. \\n \\n\\nThen I was elected to office and we raised Belvidere repeatedly with the auto company knowing unions make all the difference. \\n\\nThe UAW worked like hell to keep the plant open and get those jobs back. And together, we succeeded! \\n\\nInstead of an auto factory shutting down an auto factory is re-opening and a new state-of-the art battery factory is being built to power those cars. \\n\\nInstead of a town being left behind it’s a community moving forward again! \\n\\nBecause instead of watching auto jobs of the future go overseas 4,000 union workers with higher wages will be building that future, in Belvidere, here in America! \\n\\nHere tonight is UAW President, Shawn Fain, a great friend, and a great labor leader. \\n\\nAnd Dawn Simms, a third generation UAW worker  in Belvidere. \\n\\nShawn, I was proud to be the first President in American history to walk a picket line. \\n\\nAnd today Dawn has a job in her hometown providing stability for her family and pride and dignity. \\n\\nShowing once again, Wall Street didn’t build this country! \\n\\nThe middle class built this country! And unions built the middle class! \\n\\nWhen Americans get knocked down, we get back up! \\n\\nWe keep going! \\n\\nThat’s America! That’s you, the American people! \\n\\nIt’s because of you America is coming back!  \\n\\nIt’s because of you, our future is brighter! \\n\\nAnd it’s because of you that tonight we can proudly say the State of our Union is strong and getting stronger!  \\n \\n\\nTonight I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together. \\n\\nA future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy', ' no place in America! \\n\\nHistory is watching. \\n\\nAnd history is watching another assault on freedom.  \\n\\nJoining us tonight is Latorya Beasley, a social worker from Birmingham, Alabama. 14 months ago tonight, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF. \\n\\nShe scheduled treatments to have a second child, but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the state, unleashed by the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade. \\n\\nShe was told her dream would have to wait. \\n\\nWhat her family has gone through should never have happened. And unless Congress acts, it could happen again. \\n\\nSo tonight, let’s stand up for families like hers! \\n\\nTo my friends across the aisle, don’t keep families waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF nationwide! \\n\\nLike most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right. And I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader, defending reproductive freedom and so much more. \\n\\nBut my predecessor came to office determined  \\n\\nto see Roe v. Wade overturned. \\n\\nHe’s the reason it was overturned. In fact, he brags about it. \\n\\nLook at the chaos that has resulted. \\n\\nJoining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother  \\n\\nfrom Dallas. \\n\\nWhen she became pregnant again, the fetus had a fatal condition. \\n\\nHer doctors told Kate that her own life and her ability to have children in the future were at risk if she didn’t act. \\n\\nBecause Texas law banned abortion, Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get the care she needed. \\n\\nWhat her family has gone through should never have happened as well. But it is happening to so many others. \\n\\nThere are state laws banning the right to choose, criminalizing doctors, and forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states as well to get the care they need. \\n\\nMany of you in this Chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom. \\n\\nMy God, what freedoms will you take away next? \\n\\nIn its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade the Supreme Court majority wrote, “Women are not without – \\n\\nelectoral or political power.” \\n\\nNo kidding. \\n\\nClearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. \\n\\nThey found out though when reproductive freedom   \\n\\nwas on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again, in 2024. \\n\\nIf Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again! \\n\\nAmerica cannot go back. I am here tonight to show the way forward. Because I know how far we’ve come. \\n\\nFour years ago next week, before I came to office, our country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a century. \\n\\nRemember the fear. Record job losses. Remember the spike in crime. And the murder rate. \\n\\nA raging virus that would take more than 1 million American lives and leave millions of loved ones behind. \\n\\nA mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness. \\n\\nA president, my predecessor, who failed the most basic duty. Any President owes the American people the duty to care. \\n\\nThat is unforgivable. \\n\\nI came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in our nation’s history. \\n\\nAnd we have. It doesn’t make the news but in thousands of cities and towns the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told. \\n\\nSo let’s tell that story here and now. \\n\\nAmerica’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, investing in all of America, in all Americans to make sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind! \\n\\nThe pandemic no longer controls our lives.
