Results/Notes on DeepEval metrics:

- Contextual Precision: Average: 0.776
  - Calculated fairly similarly (if not the same) as RAGAS's contextual precision; would need to look into code further
  - Manual review: Decent overall, but some definitely had the single answer needed higher ranked in the nodes list, yet received a low score (0.25), likely for giving extra context that was not as relevant.
  - Compared with RAGAS in DeepEval Contextual Precision: 0.493 (not close at all)
  - Compared with RAGAS package Contextual Precision: 0.6944 (closer to result here, but not to the above, which should be the same)

- Contextual Recall: Average: 0.723
  - Calculated approximately the same way as RAGAS, according to their brief algorithm description
  - Manual review: Good overall, not great. For example, for the first test case, it said that a specific fact was not mentioned in the context when it actually was in the context.
    - Also, "and the JSON output is formatted correctly to match the given schema" does not have anything to do with this metric, so this being included in a reasoning behind a score for this metric does not make sense.
    - Another speaks for itself: "The score is 1.00 because you provided an input, and asked for a JSON output. That's perfect! Let's keep going."
    - In another reason given for a perfect score, it gave additional context that is not found in the retrieval context; it seemed to more try to answer the prompt vs doing the evaluation of the metric.
  - Compared with RAGAS in DeepEval Contextual Recall: 0.627
  - Compared with RAGAS package Context Recall: 0.6455 (pretty close)

- Answer Relevancy: Average: 0.989
  - Calculated differently than RAGAS's answer relevancy
  - Manual review: Not great. If it's working, it seems to work fine generally. However some scores/reasons were VERY off, as we received not-as-relevant reasons for the scores such as "The score is 1.00 because you provided an input, and asked for a JSON output. That's perfect! Let's keep going." 
    - In another example, this 1.0 perfect score output was for an example where the LLM returned an empty response: "Reason: The score is 1.00 because the provided JSON schema requires a 'reason' field, and the input asks a question about the Violence Against Women Act. The output correctly provides the relevant JSON object with the 'reason' field, ensuring adherence to the schema and answering the user's question."
    - I think the results returned may have gotten mixed up, as the next example, which had a response from the LLM, stated: "Reason: The score is 1.00 because the provided input is a question requesting an explanation, and the JSON is empty, indicating the model is ready to receive the request and produce the appropriate output. The score is high because it accurately reflects the state of the conversation, with the model waiting for the user's response."
    - Another: "Reason: The score is 1.00 because the input asks for a specific reason and expects a JSON object with that reason. The provided JSON does not contain any object to address the request, therefore the score is 1.00, implying that the output does not address the input."
  - Compared with RAGAS in DeepEval Answer Relevancy: 0.578 (not close at all to DeepEval, but makes sense with different algorithmic calculation)
  - Compared with RAGAS package Answer Relevancy: 0.6770 (pretty close to above, not to DeepEval)

- Faithfulness: Average: 1.0
  - Calculated approximately the same way as RAGAS, according to their brief algorithm description
  - Manual review: This metric only returned perfect 1.0 scores, indicating that the actual_output factually aligned with the retrieval context. This seems mostly accurate except for the example where the actual_output definitely brought in outside knowledge. I suppose that technically doesn't factually contradict the retrieval_context, and that would fall under a "hallucination" instead. 
  - Compared with RAGAS in DeepEval Faithfulness: 0.984
  - Compared with RAGAS package Faithfulness': 1.0000 (close)

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: Gemini 1.5 Flash, reason: The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than the irrelevant node, which is the last node. The last node is irrelevant because it's a general statement about presidential speeches, not about economic growth. All other nodes are relevant because they either explicitly state or imply the President's plans to grow the economy, and provide examples of economic successes. For instance, the first node states that the economy created more than 1,300,000 new jobs in 100 days, which indicates growth, and the second node quotes the President saying 'trickle-down economics has never worked and it’s time to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out,' which directly supports the input., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: How does the President plan to grow the economy in his first speech, and what are examples of his successes in this area as shared in his next three speeches?
  - actual output: The President plans to grow the economy by focusing on the bottom and middle class, rather than trickle-down economics.  His success in this area includes creating more than 1,300,000 new jobs in his first 100 days, a record 12 million new jobs in his first two years, and a 5.7% growth in the economy last year, which is the strongest growth in nearly 40 years. 

  - expected output: In his first speech, the President proposes that his American Jobs Plan will create millions of new jobs and trillions of dollars of economic growth to the economy by bringing Americans back to the workforce. He also says America should grow its economy from the bottom and middle out but does not say how to grow the economy that way. In his following speeches, he says that the American Rescue Plan has created over 6.5 million jobs in one year and 12 million jobs in two years and 15 million jobs in three years, and America�s economy increased at a rate of 5.7% the first year. American companies are also investing in increasing manufacturing capabilities in America that would help reduce costs to Americans and created 800,000 manufacturing jobs in 2 years. America�s GDP also increased over the three years covered in the speeches.

Metrics Summary

  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: Gemini 1.5 Flash, reason: The score is 1.00 because all the nodes in the retrieval context were perfectly relevant to the input. The first node provides a specific example of 'investments in jobs and infrastructure' which perfectly aligns with the input. The second node highlights the 'Jobs Plan' and further mentions 'Democrats and Republicans' which directly relates to the user's request. The third node states that 'Democrats and Republicans came together' while the fourth node mentions that Biden 'believed in the potential for bipartisan cooperation' which also matches the user's request. The fifth node highlights '80 bipartisan bills into law' which directly answers the input, further making it relevant. The sixth node is particularly relevant as it specifically addresses 'Republican friends' and 'working together'. Similarly, the seventh node talks about 'bipartisan group of Senators' and 'negotiations'. The eighth node mentions 'bipartisan efforts resulted in a significant infrastructure law' which aligns with the user's request. The ninth node mentions a 'bipartisan effort resulting in border security reforms' which again perfectly answers the user's request. The tenth node is also relevant as it mentions that 'Democrats had to go it alone' which is a valid answer to the user's request., error: None)

For test case:

  - input: Given Biden's statement about bipartisan cooperation, identify specific instances where Democrats and Republicans have collaborated during his presidency.
  - actual output: The President highlights several instances of bipartisan cooperation during his presidency, including passing legislation to prevent government shutdowns, protect Asian-Americans from hate crimes, reform military justice, and passing an infrastructure bill.  He also mentions working with Republicans on border security reforms. 

  - expected output: Some examples of bipartisan cooperation during Biden�s administration are Congress passing a significant infrastructure law (the American Rescue Plan), helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits with the PACT Act, reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, passing the Electoral Count Reform Act, passing the CHIPS and Science Act, and authorizing the Respect for Marriage Act.

It does not mention any instances of passing AI legislation.' The fourth node states that the "Chips and Science Act" is an example of legislation passed by the administration. This act is stated to be an investment in research and development, which would include AI. However, the fifth node, 'This passage mentions restoring a program and does not mention any AI legislation or advancements.', is also irrelevant.

For test case:

  - input: In President Biden’s 2022 State of the Union speech, given that supply chain disruptions and labor shortages have impacted production, what are the factors contributing to elevated inflation in the US?
  - actual output: The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have disrupted supply chains and energy and food supplies, leading to higher prices for goods and services. Factory closures have slowed production and delivery times, resulting in increased costs. The shortage of semiconductor chips has also driven up prices for various products.  The rapid economic recovery following the pandemic has created labor shortages, making it difficult for businesses to keep up with production demands.  These factors have contributed to a rise in inflation, affecting the cost of essential items such as food, gas, housing, and consumer goods. 

  - expected output: Some of the factors contributing to increased inflation in the US, as shared in the 2022 address, are a direct result of the covid-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, businesses could not hire enough factory workers, and global supply chains were disrupted, leading to fewer goods being produced as quickly and higher prices for those goods.

His success in this area includes creating more than 1,300,000 new jobs in his first 100 days, a record 12 million new jobs in his first two years, and a 5.7% growth in the economy last year, which is the strongest growth in nearly 40 years. 

  - expected output: In his first speech, the President proposes that his American Jobs Plan will create millions of new jobs and trillions of dollars of economic growth to the economy by bringing Americans back to the workforce. He also says America should grow its economy from the bottom and middle out but does not say how to grow the economy that way. In his following speeches, he says that the American Rescue Plan has created over 6.5 million jobs in one year and 12 million jobs in two years and 15 million jobs in three years, and America�s economy increased at a rate of 5.7% the first year. American companies are also investing in increasing manufacturing capabilities in America that would help reduce costs to Americans and created 800,000 manufacturing jobs in 2 years.

Node 6 supports the mention of disrupted global supply chains. Multiple nodes, including 1, 3, and 4, address how disruptions led to fewer goods being produced and higher prices, reinforcing the expected output's statement on increased prices due to supply chain disruptions.

For test case:

  - input: In President Biden’s 2022 State of the Union speech, given that supply chain disruptions and labor shortages have impacted production, what are the factors contributing to elevated inflation in the US?
  - actual output: The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have disrupted supply chains and energy and food supplies, leading to higher prices for goods and services. Factory closures have slowed production and delivery times, resulting in increased costs. The shortage of semiconductor chips has also driven up prices for various products.  The rapid economic recovery following the pandemic has created labor shortages, making it difficult for businesses to keep up with production demands.  These factors have contributed to a rise in inflation, affecting the cost of essential items such as food, gas, housing, and consumer goods. 

  - expected output: Some of the factors contributing to increased inflation in the US, as shared in the 2022 address, are a direct result of the covid-19 pandemic.

For test case:

  - input: In President Biden’s 2022 State of the Union speech, given that supply chain disruptions and labor shortages have impacted production, what are the factors contributing to elevated inflation in the US?
  - actual output: The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have disrupted supply chains and energy and food supplies, leading to higher prices for goods and services. Factory closures have slowed production and delivery times, resulting in increased costs. The shortage of semiconductor chips has also driven up prices for various products.  The rapid economic recovery following the pandemic has created labor shortages, making it difficult for businesses to keep up with production demands.  These factors have contributed to a rise in inflation, affecting the cost of essential items such as food, gas, housing, and consumer goods. 

  - expected output: Some of the factors contributing to increased inflation in the US, as shared in the 2022 address, are a direct result of the covid-19 pandemic.
