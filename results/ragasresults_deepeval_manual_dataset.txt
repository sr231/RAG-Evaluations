Individual metric results from ragas:
{'context_precision': 0.6944, 'faithfulness': 1.0000, 'answer_relevancy': 0.6770, 'context_recall': 0.6455}

Summary results from deepeval:
context_precision: 90.91% pass rate, faithfulness: 81.82% pass rate, answer_relevancy: 81.82% pass rate, context_recall: 81.82% pass rate, RAGAS: 54.55% pass rate

Overall: Similar but not the same scores between deepeval's ragas (which calls ragas) and ragas. 
I think the variance is probably fairly normal, given that I got different results each time I ran ragas as well.

Average scores from deep eval ragas:
context precision: 0.493268741183316
faithfulness: 0.984126984126984
answer_relevancy: 0.577747493385347
context_recall: 0.627272727272727

Notes from manual review of results: 
- Faithfulness scoring seemed fairly reliable. 
- Answer relevancy also seemed fairly accurate. Some of the scoring for answer relevancy was difficult to determine why one received a better score than another, but for those in question, the score was only off by 0.1 from what I expected based off of the other scoring.
- Some of the context_recall results seemed inaccurate. For example, one returned a score of 0 but in close examination, the context did contain parts of the ground truth result. For two very similar examples, scores varied from 0 to 0.5, which seemed like a dramatic variance.
- Contextual precision seemed a bit off, as some of the 1st and 2nd context nodes contained the exact answer, yet the score was 0.6 or 0.5.


Output from RAGAS metric (average of all 4 RAGAS individual metrics above):
- Output seemed inconsistent, as RAGAS metric could not be generated for 3 examples that we had results from the other 4 metrics on. Also unexpectedly, it was generated for one example that we didn't get all 4 individual results for.
- For those examples that the metric was generated on, the RAGAS metric was within .12 of the manually calculated averages. 
- This metric (when it gives output) seems like a general approximation for a given test case of how well the RAG pipeline answered it.
- The overall pass rate seems useful, but given that we got 7/11 results (including 1 questionable one) on such a small test set, I don't think I would use this metric.

  - input: How does the President plan to grow the economy in his first speech, and what are examples of his successes in this area as shared in his next three speeches?
  - actual output: The President plans to grow the economy by focusing on the bottom and middle class, rather than trickle-down economics.  His success in this area includes creating more than 1,300,000 new jobs in his first 100 days, a record 12 million new jobs in his first two years, and a 5.7% growth in the economy last year, which is the strongest growth in nearly 40 years. 

  - expected output: In his first speech, the President proposes that his American Jobs Plan will create millions of new jobs and trillions of dollars of economic growth to the economy by bringing Americans back to the workforce. He also says America should grow its economy from the bottom and middle out but does not say how to grow the economy that way. In his following speeches, he says that the American Rescue Plan has created over 6.5 million jobs in one year and 12 million jobs in two years and 15 million jobs in three years, and America�s economy increased at a rate of 5.7% the first year. American companies are also investing in increasing manufacturing capabilities in America that would help reduce costs to Americans and created 800,000 manufacturing jobs in 2 years. America�s GDP also increased over the three years covered in the speeches.

  - actual output: The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have disrupted supply chains and energy and food supplies, leading to higher prices for goods and services. Factory closures have slowed production and delivery times, resulting in increased costs. The shortage of semiconductor chips has also driven up prices for various products.  The rapid economic recovery following the pandemic has created labor shortages, making it difficult for businesses to keep up with production demands.  These factors have contributed to a rise in inflation, affecting the cost of essential items such as food, gas, housing, and consumer goods. 

  - expected output: Some of the factors contributing to increased inflation in the US, as shared in the 2022 address, are a direct result of the covid-19 pandemic.

His success in this area includes creating more than 1,300,000 new jobs in his first 100 days, a record 12 million new jobs in his first two years, and a 5.7% growth in the economy last year, which is the strongest growth in nearly 40 years.

He also says America should grow its economy from the bottom and middle out but does not say how to grow the economy that way. In his following speeches, he says that the American Rescue Plan has created over 6.5 million jobs in one year and 12 million jobs in two years and 15 million jobs in three years, and America�s economy increased at a rate of 5.7% the first year. American companies are also investing in increasing manufacturing capabilities in America that would help reduce costs to Americans and created 800,000 manufacturing jobs in 2 years. America�s GDP also increased over the three years covered in the speeches.

  - actual output: The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have disrupted supply chains and energy and food supplies, leading to higher prices for goods and services. Factory closures have slowed production and delivery times, resulting in increased costs. The shortage of semiconductor chips has also driven up prices for various products.  The rapid economic recovery following the pandemic has created labor shortages, making it difficult for businesses to keep up with production demands.  These factors have contributed to a rise in inflation, affecting the cost of essential items such as food, gas, housing, and consumer goods. 

  - expected output: Some of the factors contributing to increased inflation in the US, as shared in the 2022 address, are a direct result of the covid-19 pandemic.

  - input: In President Biden’s 2022 State of the Union speech, given that supply chain disruptions and labor shortages have impacted production, what are the factors contributing to elevated inflation in the US?
  - actual output: The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have disrupted supply chains and energy and food supplies, leading to higher prices for goods and services. Factory closures have slowed production and delivery times, resulting in increased costs. The shortage of semiconductor chips has also driven up prices for various products.  The rapid economic recovery following the pandemic has created labor shortages, making it difficult for businesses to keep up with production demands.  These factors have contributed to a rise in inflation, affecting the cost of essential items such as food, gas, housing, and consumer goods. 

  - expected output: Some of the factors contributing to increased inflation in the US, as shared in the 2022 address, are a direct result of the covid-19 pandemic.
